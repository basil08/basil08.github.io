## Introduction    

I remember quite distinctly about being informed of a student-run media body on IIT Delhi campus and immediately feeling drawn to it. I didn't know (and perhaps still don't) what was the point of it all but the infatuation was evident. I knew that I _had_ to be a part of the Board for Student Publications or BSP. One thing led to another and after a year of holding my role as a journalist for the board, I became a Chief Editor for journalism.

The BSP power structure involves a General Secretary and a Deputy General Secretary, ideally fourth year students, a team of eight Chief Editors for different verticals (Journalism, Creative, Design, and Media); all third year students - which forms the editorial panel. They manage a team of 60 odd second years students - journalists, designers, and media techies. 

Now, I absolutely adore BSP and the values it stands for and given a chance to do it all over again, I would still want to be in BSP and nowhere else. But today I have a wider and more comprehensive view of what goes inside BSP and I believe that it is no longer faithful to its ideals. This post aims to present proofs and experiences that corroborate this claim.<sup>1</sup>

## Boards and PORs

PORs or position of responsibility are something that students at IITD are subtly conditioned to acquire. I do not wish to dwell into the reason how that is achieved but suffice it to say that precedence and “senior gyaan” plays a great role. But if you question the very existence of PORs and how it is of any use to anyone, the answers are not very popular. Nobody bothers to question the system of PORs or even why they should exist even though every outgoing student would swear by the fact that PORs were not valuable. But PORs are _made valuable artificially_ by mandate from the institute. 

Why is that? So that students can keep themselves busy with these constructs and not care to ask the really pertinent questions. Who wants to keep this arrangement? Who is to benefit from this arrangement? What are the “really pertinent questions” I am talking about? The admin. IIT Delhi is a national institute where even slight mismanagement blows up into a big news which leads to bad publicity for the institute. The institute has an incentive to suppress dissident voices, not because the institute is evil but to safeguard its own image. Now, students _would_ have opinions and thoughts and aspirations and desires, some reasonable and some not so much. By institutionalising this student need and mandating the creation of boards and councils for the student bodies, it achieves this purpose. 

The admin creates these student bodies and invents PORs because now students have a greater incentive to run for a POR than to actually care and talk about things that matter and things that are going wrong. By diverting the attention of the mass, the admin is free to do whatever it feels like. But why do students fall for PORs in the first place? Voila! By mandating PORs as the _only_ legitimate source of credentials on one’s CV. You have just turned a bunch of the brightest in the country into an army of compliant employees.<sup>6</sup> 


## What the fuss about IIT?   

Now, it is appropriate to point out the mindset differences between an IITian and a non-IITian student. The societal circumstances are such that an IITian is confident to land a decent job by following a conventional path that has been followed by their seniors etc, without having to care about any other alternative. However it has come to fruition, but an average IITian has a very healthy chance of leading a secure life if they follow a "recipe", push a few buttons at the right time, collect PORs, that kind of thing<sup>5</sup>. This cannot be said about the non-IITian who has to look for other alternatives whatever that might be. With a strong prior towards this, students have a strong incentive to safeguard this path and not get involved in any trouble with the admin. Submissivity by design. For what is more wrong than bright peeps<sup>7</sup> refusing to talk about mess worker rights or campus politics?

## Extending compliance to BSP   

BSP is the only body where professors nominate the team rather than elect. The admin justifies this stance by (rightfully) claiming that an elected BSP team would be a result of harsh political tussle. And such a team would be extremely biassed towards a certain group of people on campus. This might be a partial reason but a media body is accountable to the entire student body and any attempt to monopolise a media body would result in student protests and as expected in any democracy, the system would correct itself. Perhaps, the admin is correct in assuming that atleast the IIT populace would be too disinterested to participate in such a mechanism. Or perhaps, it is not. 

It was only last year that BSP was given immunity against unconditional censorship and intervention by the admin after a rather ugly episode of an article on casteism on campus was taken down. The article was applauded at the national level. Even then, if someone analyses the composition of the editorial panel for the last few years, they will notice that the members are specifically chosen who exhibit moderate emotions and are expected to be docile in case of a conflict with the admin (because only BSP enjoys considerable freedom to question the admin by means of its works).


## Two tales (and perhaps more?)

Let me recall two fresh incidents from my memory to substantiate this claim.

The second RDV pronite for this year was a chaotic failure. A stampede followed mismanagement leading to a number of casualties. Such a prominent and straight-forward incident was not reported by BSP. This is what has led to the decline in the credibility of the board as a media body. Now, I understand that BSP journalists and editors are not paid like a normal media body so they don’t have an obligation to actually work. Just the bare minimum amount of work to put in the annual report is fine. This idea of complacency leads to delays and eventual cancellation of projects at a scale that is unprecedented (and frankly incorrigible) for a college media body. Unfortunately, most people under BSP come to BSP for ulterior motives and not for the sake of journalism itself. And that is sad indeed.

There have been three incidents of infrastructural malfunction in Karakoram hostel in the past two years (with damange to property _and_ human life) and nobody in BSP knows about it. Isn’t that funny? It is because BSP is currently too busy publishing its set of cute little articles on MyExperiments, Prof Next Door, etc. It has become so comfortable with publishing articles of humanitarian values that it has forgotten what else it is capable of and what it is expected to do. Not to say that I am against humanitarian articles (They make for fun reads). Currently, BSP is catering to a very very select section of the IITD junta, those who are already fluent in English and are kinda elite belonging to Tier 1 cities. And that is very sad. 

## The dilemma of information dealers   

I have been talking to a number of people around me, seniors and passouts to gain perspective on the board. To understand what the student body expects of the body and hopefully let these expectations guide me in my role as an editor. And we all converged on the idea that BSP cannot and should not force people to decide what they should read. BSP should not be a dictator. But it should simply focus on creating quality journalist pieces and putting them out there. And it is generally agreed that people _will_ notice work and ideas that add value to their lives. Currently that is missing in a major way from the works of BSP. Someone might say that by putting content on topic A, you are implicitly making the decision for people to read and know about topic A and not topic B and that is true. But by not publishing anything at all, ain’t we making the same decision for the people?

### What is a responsibility?   

Being a part of a media body raises even deeper questions about my responsibilities and expected behaviour. I reckon most people seldom think this much about their PORs, atleast not anyone in my acquaintance. A responsibility doesn't entitle someone to one more point on their CV or whatever ulterior benefit they derive from it. That benefit is a token of appreciation from people around them for their service. It's a forward causal phenomenon, not the other way around. But what use would such appreciation mean for someone who doesn't do their duty sincerely?

Apologies that I digressed, ah yes, the deeper questions about information dissemination. I think I can explain this better through a metaphor because that's how I conceived it when I asked myself the question, "What is the duty of an editor?"   

Imagine that each individual is a streetlamp and the area illuminated by the lamp is the area of understanding of that person. It may be possible that two lamps illuminate the same area in which case these individuals agree with each other but for the most part, each lamps is only ever capable of illuminating a fraction of the entire area that _can be illuminated_. The responsibility of the editor is to illuminate as large an  area as possible.<sup>2</sup>   

Organisations and people structures make better decisions and democracies work better when everyone is on the same page<sup>3</sup>. In an ideal democracy with zero arbitrage for information (heyo, trader folks out there ^_^), most people would vote for policies that promote an equitable society because most people ain't inherently bad or selfish or evil<sup>4</sup>. The society isn't ideal because there are irreversible actions and unreachable forces that sustain structures that enable information assymmetry.

## Parting thoughts    

The purpose of this article is not to demonise BSP or even the admin. I understand that the admin functions under constraints that students cannot even comprehend. But this article is supposed to lay flat the things that may not be plain in sight. I love BSP more than anything and I stand by the constitution and values of the board more than ever. It has given me many memories and many friends, and added much value to my life. Perhaps people will begin to understand what BSP is really capable of and make it a board that is credible and adds value to everyone around it.

1: I must warn the reader to exercise extreme personal discretion while reading this article. It might contain information that will be hard to digest in the beginning or against the popular belief. It is impossible to write anything without taking a stance. But again, that is no reason to stop talking about things that should be talked about. 

2: Okay for the pedantics, this is not a strictly correct metaphor because what I am saying would imply agreeing with a whole bunch of people. But what I am driving at is to help people expand their areas of illumination by giving them information they do not have access to under normal circumstances. 

3: Easy to say but very very very hard to achieve.

4: A reasonable assumption.

5: Note that this is NOT representative of the entire IITD populace. This is how the general trend feels like when you step into an IIT and look around. Nothing great, nothing grand, just rat-races all the way down.   

6: I think it's fair to call them employees because PORs _do_ have value at the end of the day and those are liable to be confiscated too.  

7: Readers might notice the word "bright" being used more often than not. I should point out that even though some people might feel that they are entitled to that adjective simple because of their admission into their IIT, most of these people are actually bright. There is nothing wrong to point out a fact.
