I hate when people superficially talk about emotions just to get what they desire.  

I am a perceptive person (painfully so) and it shows. Maybe, it's an effect of reading too much Tao Te Ching at a relatively young age. And what's bizarre is that it is totally unpolluted by lust. I feel love towards the silliest and most naive of things. Does that make me weak? Far from it.    

It is difficult for me to adore a lot of things. Why? Because I hate to superficially love. Woe on such love and such people who yield it. How can love be diminished?  

Naturally, I am _very_ thoughtful about things I can adore. But this sacrifice does grant me what I want. The clarity of emotion that it ensures cannot be tasted by most. As a corollary, it is disaster when I'm not as thoughtful. Maybe, this has to go? 

All this time, I had been such a fool, searching for comfort desperately, cursing nature and the unseen. Yet, all this while, it had been working for me. All those desperate nights and alien mornings have enabled the present. The Fates must have been laughing at me as they spun my thread.  

**Writing "Insomnia" felt real and natural.** It obviously, _isn't_ one of my literary masterpieces, rather it's jagged and sloppy and very avant-garde. But that crudeness leads to something measured words cannot express: Honesty. Hands down, it is my favourite post on the blog.            

That night, the muse sang to me. I wrote my hearts out, like a man possessed. Yes, I felt the tickle. And somehow, the idea of interlacing information of the music I was listening to back then adds an unusual sense of spontaneity to it. The midsentence abrupt disruptions to the flow of thoughts just to talk about the song that started playing is reminiscient of how thoughts were playing out in my head that night. The haphazard thoughts that came in quick succession all found articulation as such. I can feel that night rushing through me each time I read that post and that is incredible. **I think the work is untidy and nonconformist. And that is art.**
