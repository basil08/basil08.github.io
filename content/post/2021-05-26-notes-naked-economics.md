Personal notes on "Naked Economics" by Charles Wheelan.  


## Free markets and their characteristics   

* Large economy involve billions of transactions - most of them without govt involvement.  

* Individuals act to make themselves as well off as possible ie seek to maximize their utility.  

* Different individuals have different preferences, priorities, anxieties and aspirations.  

* "Luxury good" &ndash; Stuff we buy because _we can_.  

* Maximizing utility is not synonymous with acting selfishly.  

* All try to make best possible decision with given info at any point of time.  

* Balancing the value of consumption now against consumption in the future (work vs leisure).  

* All of us implicitly weigh cost and benefits of everything we do.  

* Every aspect of human behaviour react to cost in some way.  

* Firms &mdash; "How can we make more profits?" 

* Market economies direct resources to their most productive use.

* Expensive things are in demand so producers target those, thereby driving the price down. But not every market is easy to enter.    

* Network effect &ndash;  the value of some goods rises with the number of other people using them.  

* Price discrimination &ndash; sell the same item to different people at different prices (to maximize profits). Entire data science and analytics.   

* Profit inspires some of our greatest work.  

* Market rewards scarcity, which has no inherent relation to value. It provides good _we want to buy_, not _what we need_. Eg: diamond instead of water, prostitution.    

* Uses price to allocate resources.   

* Because we use price to allocate goods, most markets self-correct themselves.  

* If we fix prices in a market system, firms will find other ways to compete.   

* Every market transaction makes all parties better off otherwise, they won't agree to transact.  

* Humans lack self-discipline and self-control (and sometimes, knowledge).  

* "Bounded rationality" &ndash; Using intuitions or rules of thumb to make decisions.  

* Market economy aligns with our view of personal liberty &ndash; where to live, what to do, how to spend. But humans are fundamentally flawed, emotion driven beings.  

## Incentives  

* "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest." &ndash; Adam Smith. Thus, incentives matter.  

* Self-interest makes the world go around.  

* In any system that does not rely on markets, personal incentives are usually divorced from productivity.   

* Raising prices reduces demand.  

* Good policy uses incentives to channel behavior towards some desired outcome. Bad policy either ignores incentives, or fails to anticipate how rational individuals might change their behavior to avoid being penalized.  

* "Principal-agent problem" &ndash; misaligned incentives.  

* Challenge is to reward good outcomes without creating incentives for employees to game the system that damage the company in the long run.  

* Similar incentives is NOT identical incentives.  

* Logical behavior of rational humans acting in their own best interest end up making the situation worse off for all &mdash; Prisoner's dilemma.  

* "Creative destruction" &ndash; market economies rewards winners _and_ crushes losers.  

* Creative destruction is a tremendous positive force in the long run.   

* Taxes provide powerful incentives to avoid or reduce the activity being taxed.  

* "Deadweight loss" &ndash; Taxes that make individuals worse off without making anyone better off.   

* Broad tax &ndash; small tax on large group as oppose to large tax on small group.

* Regressive tax &ndash; tax that falls heavily on poor than the rich. Progressive tax &ndash; that fall heavily on rich than the poor.  

## Good Government   

## Bad Government

*  

## Globalization  

* We trade with others because it frees up time and resources to do things that we are better at.  

* Countries are poor because they are not productive. Comparative advantage &ndash; Let Bangladeshi labor sew your shirt while you create the next big app.   

* Productivity is what makes us rich. Specialization is what makes us productive. Trade allows us to specialize.  

* Trade creates losers. Displaced workers often have a skills problem.  

* Winners should write checks (if indirectly) to the losers.   

* Protectionism saves job in the short run and slows economic growth in the long run.   

* Punish rogue nations by imposing economic sanctions.  

* Trade lowers the cost of goods for consumers which is same as raising their incomes.  

* Trade gives poor countries access to markets in the developed world.    

* Foreign companies introduce capital, technology and new skills.  

* Asian sweatshops tend to generate the wealth to solve the problems they create.  

* Trade is based on voluntary exchange. Though "cultural homogenization" - particularly America - is a threat against globalization, culture is transmitted by all in all directions.  

* The simplest way to help the poorest Asians would be to buy more from sweatshops, not less.   

* Preferences change with income, particularly wrt environment.  

* Keeping people poor because it's good for the planet is economically and morally bankrupt.  

## Development Economics  

* No effective recipe for development.  

* Effective government institutions: corruption is **bad**. Governance indices: accountability, regulatory burden, rule of law, graft etc.   

* Property rights: Informal property rights are woefully inadequate for a more complex economy. 

* Property rights: enable people to spend less time defending their possessions thus, more productive.  

* Samaritan's dilemma: Easing hardship creates less incentive to help yourself. Creating property rights encourages work.  

* No excessive regulation: Bureaucrats have incentive hurdles to extort bribes.  

* Human Capital: Skilled workers usually need other skilled workers in order to succeed ("Brain drain").  

* Geography: High temperatures and heavy rainfall are bad for food production and conducive to the spread of disease.  

* Geography: Encourage more technological innovation aimed at the unique ecology of the tropics.  

* Openess to trade: Closed economies tend to get lazy and inefficient.  

* Responsible fiscal and monetary policy: -

* Resources: Usually is a deteriment to development.  

* Democracy: Check against egregious economic policies.  

* War is bad: -

* Woman power: Better accountable for money in the house than man.
