## Abstract   

What a marvellous year this has been! The whole world united as a global community against one common miscreant. Everyone sharing everyone else's joys and sufferings. Governments getting toppled, new milestones being reached. A year most certainly going down in history as _unconventional_.      

<!--more-->
But wait, this post is not about me philosophizing about the world. It's about me. On a personal level, I never had such an exhilarating year. Regrets, sufferings, oppurtunities, challenges, rewards, success, failure and of course, knowledge - all now muddled into a fuzzy warm tingling in my head.   

### School thrown off its feet   

It was amusing to observe established slumbers hasten to safeguard their existence in the intense topsy-turvy landscape of 2020. A prime example was ,of course, the fucked up education system. With the management trying hard to cover its head and extract money, to teachers dancing to the tunes of the 'upper levels', to the oh-so-familiar 'ting' sound of google meet, to senseless accusations by powerless invigilators during online(:joy:) exams, to excruciating stress to meet the demands and deadlines of hapless sadistic teachers, we braved it all.  

I pray, they give more brain to these grown-up 'adults'.   

### Reading Books    

I have read a total of [22 books][bookshelf] _completely_ along with uncounted manuals (like LaTeX), papers (like P2P) and other stuff. This includes fiction and non-fiction (mostly tech, science etc). **A Thousand Splendid Sun** by Khaled Hosseini is my favourite fiction read and **The Selfish Gene** by Richard Dawkins in the non-fiction group. I also admit to have left an (almost) equal number of books midway :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.    

I will more actively work towards increasing the diversity of subjects I read on (things outside my comfort zone), extract more value from whatever books I read and of course, do away with this bad habit of leaving books midway (!)   

### Installing Debian on a VM  

And I loved it. As soon as I get my new machine, I'll install Manjaro or Arch on it (obviously).  

### Full stack    

Somewhere in the middle of 2020, having nothing else to do (and completely losing interest in academics) I decided to dip my fingers into web development. And so it began, MDN, then books, then frameworks and then all out full stack (MERN mostly but open to anything). This blog is a prime motivation for learning full stack.   

Admittedly, full stack is a _vast_ (read: very vast) domain and I wish to further my learning and experience, possibly work in gigs, projects, hackathons and OSS.   

### Topcoder    

Probably the thing I am most proud to have achieved this year! My own first earnings! Though I made around 14K, most crucial was my informal announcement to my parents that I can do my own stuff and support myself. And trust me, nothing is as sweet as that whiff of freedom.    

As you may understand, I achieved nothing in terms of software aptitude and I aim to improve that exponentially this year.   

### Blogging (how can I forget you?)   

Possibly the one thing that kept me sane this year. I suffered from substantial depression in the middle of the year but I don't speak out. Writing stuff down and knowing its 'out there' gave me a strange sense of comfort. Thank you.  

### Cocteau Twins   

Just one word: obssessed!   

Call me crazy but an entry on my 2021 bucket list is to meet Liz Fraser IRL :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:! I poured my heart out in [this][ct] post which also happens to be my first ever blog post!     

### First Hackathon   

Definitely not my last! I literally felt like a boy [viewing the world][hackathon] through a key hole.   

### Open source contribution and Hacktoberfest    

By sheer serendipity did I stumble upon this event for which I am so grateful. At some point, I almost gave up hope but revamped in the last few days. I am so glad to have nudged myself to [fulfill this opportunity][hacktoberfest]. Can't wait for [next year][hacktoberfestofficial]!    

### Discord Bot   

2 months for this year to expire and suddenly I wanted to make a Discord bot for my friend's server and so was born [Mayhem][mayhem]. It's a bot closely modelled around the approach discussed in [discordjs guide][discordjsguide]. Hosted happily on repl.it!   

### My own phone    

Well, extremely proud because I bought it with my money (ehm..with some help from father). It's a Redmi Note 9 sea green colour model. Hah, and how I conquered it in that Amazon flash sale is another story!    

### My first music buying expedition   

Prodigal? I don't think so. I allowed myself this much indulgence cause why not. And besides, did reason prevail anyway in 2020? Know more abou' what I bought and dwell in the [details][musicbuy].   

### My first Arduino    

It's a Arduino UNO clone which I bought from Amazon with the LSA money. Have only ran the blink led sketch for now.   

### React Native   

My first foray into mobile development. Though I didn't make any 'conventional app', I loved the Expo ecosystem and can't wait to dip my hands deeper into it this year along with QA and all.   

### Virutal Inter-school events   

This year I participated in a number of fests. LSA fest contest was a CS themed puzzle competition for team of two. Very basic crypto stuff and common sense.   

And then there was SXCS (another school) Coding contest, where my part was to lead the competitive programming part. Our team stood 2nd runners up overall. When I introspect, I realized that this was my last ever school fest which kinda makes me gloomy.   

### Photomath   

Serendipity abounds in 2020 for me. Things changed when my eyes scanned a PM ad on a random site I was browsing. And there I was in the PM portal, reading manuals, instructions, preparing for the PM Math Expert exam and taking tests. I certified as a PM Math Content Creator (they call that 'Math Expert' but I believe it's a misnomer) and made content for quite sometime. I made around $50 which is ok.   

I was active for a month or so but am currently inactive. Learning GeoGebra was a useful by-product, I believe.   

### Buying stuff for dad!   

Yep, couldn't be more proud.   

### _Social Media_   

Twitter, LinkedIn and Discord. Phew! I'm the enchanted key-hole boy(!) Rather, suddenly, did it revealed unto me that they are super time wasters and I have limited my usage. Uninstalled Discord and Twitter for starters.   

After all, I want to be a creator of technology not a consumer of one.   

### JBNSTS Camp Cancelled   

2020 had it's fair share of sadness. The most heart-breaking for me was the cancellation of a number of science camps they organize for scholars to expose them to extra-curricular science. I have been to NISER for NTSE Science camp in 2019 and I loved it, science, friends, the bonding, the environment and most importantly, the freedom.  

If it were not for the pandemic, I would have been off for ~5 days to IISER Kalyani with my friends and fascinating science. 

### KVPY Camp Cancelled   

I remember the KVPY Camp being such a strong motivation for me to overcome my challenges and crack this exam and its such a heart-ache that its all a sad dream. Argh, life's unfair, sure.   

## Things I missed   

I couldn't quite do everything I had planned to do and did a lot of things I absolutely didn't. But then that's ok.  

### Macbook  

I had set a target for myself to get a Macbook (my current laptop is the epitome of pain and torture :confounded:) by the end of the year, self-financing myself. An ambitious aim, no doubt, but I am glad I could conceive of it.  

### 65c02 microprocessor  

I want to tinker with this processor. Maybe, I'll just look at some PIC16F8XX series for now. They have dev board, programmer all included at the cost of a mere 6502 but then, the specs differ widely. Maybe I'm too broke for this right now.   

### Raspberry Pi 400  

Just on a random pandemic day, I read about 400 in my news feed and gosh, do I want this! It's around 9K (taxes :weary:) and father has agreed to get me one _after_ entrance exams. I listen to my father no matter what so I'll just wait around.  


## Looking forward to 2021    

For me, 2020 has been a year of self-revelation and realization. I am, therefore, most excited to apply what I have learned and realize the dreams that I have lived. 2021 will hopefully be my year of expression.
