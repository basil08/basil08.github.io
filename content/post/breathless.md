NOTES:

## Slate - https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2010/06/how-jean-luc-godard-s-breathless-reinvented-the-movies.html

How Breathless started:
rush of envy when his friend Truffaut (The 400 Blows) won big at Cannes,

Breathless is ...  his idea of a fast-paced gangster flick transplanted to the Paris streets.

The "French attitude"
The "American attitude"
Breathless is an orchestrated dialogue between two worlds—a world of stylized Hollywood romanticism and the everyday world of banal, uncinematic life

It’s Godard’s careful counterpoint between these two styles that helped him tease out a “French attitude” and gave the movie its relentless drive.


. In Breathless, every leading character—even the city of Paris itself—tries to reach past the grind of normal life to claim a new, exotic role.

upfront about its Hollywood debts
literally, a French-American love affair
set during President Eisenhower’s visit to Paris to see de Gaulle, no less

Why Breathless called Breathless? : More like "out of breath", "rush", "springtly", not the romantic "out of breath".

car-culture film


What’s daring and charismatic in the subtropics of Florida or L.A. becomes, in the bright light of Paris’ boulevards, a little silly.

This hue of absurdity, like most of Breathless’ qualities, developed largely in production
“[O]ne never does exactly what one intended. Sometimes one even does the opposite,” Godard said.

### Production [+]
its dissonance: the conflict between what Breathless purported to be (an exotic Sin City flick) and what it delivered (scenes from commonplace Paris).

“I realized that [Breathless] was not at all what I thought. I thought I had made a realistic film like Richard Quine’s Pushover, but it wasn’t that at all.” The noir realism he’d sought turned disingenuous because he “didn’t have enough technical skill,” he claimed

Breathless was filmed with light equipment and a small crew, and Godard designed each scene the day of the shoot from notes he’d made

### Role of Raoul Coutard, the cinematographer
How when they could not afford tracks for a tracking shot, he held the camera and had himself pushed in a wheelchair. How he achieved a grainy look that influenced many other fiction films that wanted to seem realistic. How he scorned fancy lighting. How he used hand-held techniques even before lightweight cameras were available. How he timed one shot of Belmondo so that the streetlights on the Champs Elysses came on behind him.

The technique "was a little more accidental than political," writes the Australian critic Jonathan Dawson. The finished film was 30 minutes too long, and "rather than cut out whole scenes or sequences, Godard elected to trim within the scene, creating the jagged cutting style still so beloved of action filmmakers. Godard just went at the film with the scissors, cutting out anything he thought boring."



Where the noir of Quine and Hawks took scripted, processed cinematic fiction and imbued it with real human stakes, Godard took footage with the spontaneity, rhythms, and anonymity of banal life and braided it on-screen with stylized cinematic fiction.

Jean-Pierre Melville who played the writer interviewed by Patricia Franchini (Jean Seaberg)

"Two things are important in life. For men, women. For women, money"

### Influence and Legacy
The movie was a crucial influence during Hollywood's 1967-1974 golden age. You cannot even begin to count the characters played by Pacino, Beatty, Nicholson, Penn, who are directly descended from Jean-Paul Belmondo's insouciant killer Michel.

Her Patricia is the great enigma of the movie.

Crowther of the Times, critic:
"sordid is really a mild word for its pile-up of gross indecencies." The jump cuts to him were "pictorial cacophony."


### Technique of jump cutting


### A clash of styles [+]

The interval shot roughly in the middle of the film with Michel and Patricia in Patricia's room has them just lazing around, talking, fighting, making love. It stands in direct contradiction to the fast-paced nature and general theme of the gangster flick movie that has a lot of car chasing, killing, confrontation, and suspense.

In flipping between these styles—one ragged, unplotted, and pedestrian; the other glamorous and reeking of the storyboard—Godard was not trying to pick a fight with Hollywood’s mien or to lampoon audience expectation. (That came later.) He was trying to make a film that, at each turn, broke with his culture’s notion of what French movies were supposed to be.

Breathless is breezily amoral.

Faulkner: "Between grief and nothing, I will take grief."

It was, perhaps, cinema’s overdue equivalent of nineteenth-century French Impressionist painting or the subsequent Cubist movement led by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.


TODO: a feel of events and life unfolding naturally before our eyes. How to do this more effective?


The ability of cinematography to touch and become one with the real world had perhaps never been so fully realised. This was the quality that Godard and his fellow New Wave critics-turned-directors had admired in the great silent films they saw together at the pioneering archivist Henri Langlois’s Cinematheque Francaise and in the works of Jean Renoir, Roberto Rossellini and Alfred Hitchcock.


destiny is playing out its cruel hand as demanded by the cinematic codes of gangster and noir films.
The protag is on the run, accompanied by his beautiful girlfriend. But this is exactly where Godard chooses to break the mold when he makes the girlfriend betray the protag in a rebellious fit against the noir code of films.

DRAFT


## Introduction

{{<dropcap>}}Art{{</dropcap>}}, by its very nature, challenges the status quo. It has the power, and I would argue, responsibility, to sway people to stand up against unjust and authoritarian regimes. It serves as the voice of the marginalised and the voiceless. The twentieth century philosopher Theodore Adorno famously said,

{{<bq>}}
"All art is an uncommitted crime".

~Theodore Adorno
{{</bq>}}

The acclaimed Spanish painter, Pablo Picasso painted [The Guernica][0] as an expression of protest against war. Its explicit and ghastly imagery has been used in anti-war protests ever since. Or, take contemporary artist Banksy's protest poster for _Black Lives Matter_ which shows an American flag catching a fire by a vigil candle beside a framed photograph of an unknown person.

Paradoxically, the imaginatively free artist is a prisoner of their era. Their protest must be subtle, but potent for it must awaken the oppressed without awakening the oppressors. But to achieve this adroit mode of expression is a challenging task. The 1960s saw the French cinematic landscape waking up to an obtuse and blatant attack on their culture by the Americans &mdash; a cultural attack. In such a state of jeopardy, the burden fell on a group of young French film-makers to _define_ a truly French style of making films.

Jean Luc-Godard, along with Truffant and Resnais pioneered this task and gifted the world, a new form of film-making; one completely detached from American roots and in glaring defiance of the conventional "acceptable" ways of filmmaking. _Breathless_ was Godard's debut feature length film that took the world by storm and together with Truffant's _The 400 Blows_ and Resnais' _Hiroshima Mon Amour_ ushered what was to be christened the so-called "French New Wave".

If you watch Breathless for the first time, chances are that you will find it rather uninteresting. I can recall thinking to myself, "What's the big deal?" after my first viewing. Curious (read: anxious) and unsettled, I set out to find an answer to that question. Just like a tourist whose appreciation for a monument is diminished because of a lack of sound grounding in the context, culture, and history of the place, it is difficult to convey what _Breathless_ really stands for, if viewed superficially. This post is my attempt to note some and hopefully make my reader appreciate this genius tour de force.


Breathless was less of a movie and more of a symbol of protest. A rebuttal. A counter-attack. But to understand its significance is to first understand the time in which it appeared.

### What was the French New Wave? What started it?

In 1946, an agreement was signed between American Secretary of State, James F. Brynes and Leon Blum, a representative for the French government, to wipe away France's war debt by opening American markets to French consumers after France's liberation from Nazi control. This agreement was called the Blum-Brynes Accords and it shaped the French culture at an astounding rate. This event triggered a chain of interesting events, the ushering of the French New Wave movement being one of them.

By 1948, barely two years after the Blum-Brynes Accords, 222 American films populated French cinemas. This shocked French fimmakers because a meagre 89 French films were released that year and only 8 from other countries. The American economic upperhand was posing a serious threat to the identity and existence of French cinema and in turn, French culture. It was a wake-up call for French filmmakers, a call -to-action, if you will. In such a setting,

### Can a nation's identity be based on another nation's?

Michel models himself off the film persona of the famous Hollywood actor Humphrey Bogart in a similar manner by which Breathless both models and parodies itself as a classic American Noir movie.

In the middle of the film, the connection between Michel and Bogart becomes even more overt. Michel examines a larger-than-life poster of Bogart for his final film The Harder They Fall (1956): in this shot, Michel’s reflection is literally dwarfed in Bogart’s shadow. This shot is reflecting the fact that Michel’s lack of identity cannot be supplemented by just mimicking a symbol of classic Hollywood.

This directly translates into an adept criticism by Godard concerning the French trying to emulate and adopt American culture.


The finale of the film drives home Godard’s message that the unity between Patricia, Michel’s American girlfriend, and Michel–which mirrors the unity between France and America both during and after the Blum-Byrnes Accords–is inherently exploitative.

Patricia, betraying Michel to the cops, watches as Michel is gunned down.

the union between Patricia and Michel was never going to work. Patricia violates Michel’s love in the same way that Hollywood, with the help of the American government, violated French theaters.

By 1948, barely two years after the Blum-Byrnes Accords, 222 American films populated French cinemas. This number, compared to the 89 French films, and only 8 films from other countries released that year, understandably shocking for French filmmakers.

American economic dominance over French culture produced a cognitive dissonance for the identity of French filmmakers.

> Breathless is an act of rebellion, it is a outpouring of protest, an attempt to safeguard a nation's culture, a political protest as much as it is avant-garde.

> Breathless is genius because in it Godard not only asks the question (or rather shows the eminent crisis to the audience) but at the same time provide a solution to that crisis in the medium itself. To break out of the American "conventional" style of filmmaking would be to emulate something like he did in Breathless, jump cuts and all. To truly cultivate an original French style of filmmaking. But Godard is walking a fine line here. To announce openly of a cultural independence from the American would be impossible. Because Am economic dominance was source of dissonance for the very identity of the French filmmakers as they quickly saw their profession jeopardised by the American films flooding the French theaters.

This is not a review. It's an outpouring of appreciation and respect rather than criticism or in worse cases, hostility. It is the net sum of my desire to understand what's the big deal anyway and finding something rewarding. AN attempt to convey that satisfaction. And a genuine solemn tribute.
