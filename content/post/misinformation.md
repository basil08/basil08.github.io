The other day, my mother told me that I ought to rub lemon juice mixed with something equally ridiculous on my face to get a glowing skin. I just stared at her in wonder. Sometime during the early days of COVID-19, she cheerily asserted that black pepper, water, and something else can kill the virus _inside_ the human body. It turned out that the source of these eccentric remedies and cures was a distant aunt who found it her most sincere responsibility to forward such ludicrous information in family Whatsapp groups and "save her dear ones". 

On holidays, my father remains glued to his mobile phone watching political videos on FB and making occasional grunting noises. Then, he'd suddenly break out of his daze and proclaim something radical or outrageous and nod satisfactorily.  

Misinformation on the Internet has become a most grave problem. As I have often pointed out, lack of information or even worse, partial information will invariably always lead to unstable societies. In today's democratic web, _everybody_ has a voice which makes the audience so much more vulnerable as to whom to listen to. After all, who we choose to listen to will make all the difference.  

## Scenario in India   

I chose to write this post because of the alarming rise in the number of ludicrous incidents  such as the ones cherry-picked in the beginning of this post. India, with a population of 1.3 billion people, more than 50% of them illiterate and hence, unemployed and starving and homeless serve as the perfect propagation grounds for misinformation. With editing and creation suites being offered as SaaS on the cloud, even high school kids with the expertise, intent, and a few bucks to spare, can unleash havoc if they so will. My concerns are not speculations. This _is happening today_. The Indian cybersecurity wing is already struggling to track down cybercriminals. How can we expect them to concern themselves with "minor issues" like minformation when there are bigger ones like digital break-in in national banks and so forth? Who will regulate prominent social networking sites since they clearly can't do it themselves?  






Confronting elders in these matters is tricky.
