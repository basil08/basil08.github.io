{{<dropcap>}} American artist {{</dropcap>}} and painter, Edward Hopper, didn't achieve much recognition in his lifetime. Today, critics laud his work as quintessential "American" in spirit as he developed a distinctive signature style. His personal life was fraught with toil and resentment as he watched his contemporaries rise to fame and fortune. He was a married man who had no children and his wife stood as a pillar of support, augmenting his intellect, emotion and career. He was a shy, quiet, somewhat reclusive artist who was appalled by abstract modernism and its advent in the American art landscape. He was cynical of critics who failed to share his viewpoint that art is an expression of an artist's emotional conscience.

{{<bq>}} "Great art is the outward expression of an inner life in the artist, and this inner life will result in his personal vision of the world ... The inner life of a human being is a vast and varied realm."   

<cite>~Edward Hopper</cite>
{{</bq>}}

This post is my evaluation and learning of the man and his works. 

## DEVELOPMENT   

{{<figure src="/img/hopper/7.jpg" caption="**Summer Interior**, Ed. Hopper, 1909, Oil on canvas, 24 x 29 in.">}}

Edward Hopper was the second child of Garrett H. Hopper and Elizabeth G. Smith, born in 1882 in Nyack, New York. Belonging to a middle-class household, he showed inclination towards art; a somewhat precocious child, he signed and dated his sketching from the age of ten. He was exceptionally tall, already six feets by his twelfth birthday and his physique isolated him psychologically from his peers through his life.  

He read varied writers such as Victor Hugo, Arthur Rimbaud, Thomas Mann, Goethe, Marcel Proust, Emerson, Robert Frost, Henrik Ibsen, Ernst Hemingway avidly from his father's library whom he remarked as "an incipient intellectual who never quite made it" and was intimately familiar with the writings of Sigmond Freud and Carl Jung.    

After graduation from Nyack High School, he studied art at Chase School under the guidance of Robert Henri and Kenneth Hayes Miller. He took up a job as an illustrator to support himself but he resented that occupation throughout his life.   

He travelled to Europe, visiting England, Holland, Germany and Belgium while staying at Paris in 1906 to 1907. He made two subsequent trips to Europe in 1909 and 1910 and brought with him an admiration for Paris and parisians.  

{{<bq>}} "Paris is a very graceful and beautiful city, almost too formal and sweet to the taste after the raw disorder of New York. Everything seems to have been planned with the purpose of forming a most harmonious whole which certainly has been done." 
{{</bq>}}

## FRENCH INFLUENCE AND FINDING AN AMERICAN STYLE  

{{<figure src="/img/hopper/6.jpg" caption="**Night Windows**, Ed. Hopper, 1928, Oil on canvas, 29 x 34 in.">}}

Hopper appeared at the New York art scene when critics and artists were talking about _"cultural nationalism"_ &mdash; a phrase to emphasize a dire need for the artists, dramatists and writers to develop "a home-grown art, out of our own soil". His early works influenced by French landscapes and philosophies, such as the monumental _"Soir Bleu"_ rose to tepid critical acclaim in a group exhibition in 1915. These encounters made Hopper self-critical and demanding of himself as an artist. Self-doubtful, he grew cynical of critics:  

{{<bq>}} "I don't know what my identity is. The critics give you an identity. And sometimes, even you give it a push."
 {{</bq>}}

...as for artists, he remarked:  

{{<bq>}} "Ninety per cent of them are forgotten ten minutes after they are dead." 
{{</bq>}}

All this not to form a cold, harsh image of the man. His sense of humor, though submerged, was profound. His youthful caricatures and cartoons hint at his playful side. In one from 1900, all four diners at a boardinghouse request chicked legs &ndash; to which the landlady remarked in visible disagreement: "Gentlemen, a chicken is not a quadruped". His romantic nature is seen in etchings such as _"Les Deux Pigeons"_ (1920) and _"Summer Afternoon"_ (1947).   

{{<figure src="/img/hopper/15.jpg" width="500px" caption="**Morning in a City**, Ed. Hopper, 1944, Oil on canvas, 44 5/16 x 59 13/16 in.">}}

He only revealed his romance and intellectual sophistication to his wife Josephine Nivison to whom he was married till his death in 1967 for forty-three years. Jo, herself an artist, subjugated her career for her husband and was possessive of him, insisting on being the model for all his female figures.  

Hopper insisted on his works being identified as an expression, a projection of his psyche and not a singular cultural pronounciation.  

{{<bq>}} 
"The American quality is _in_ a painter &mdash; he doesn't have to strive for it"
{{</bq>}}

He associated his art with his inner feelings as highlighted by a quotation by Goethe he carried in his wallet:  

{{<bq>}} 
"The beginning and end of all literary activity is the reproduction of the world that surrounds me by means of the world that is in me, all things being grasped, related, retreated, moulded and reconstructed in a personal form and an original manner."  
{{</bq>}}   

{{<figure src="/img/hopper/3.jpg" width="400px" caption="**Office at Night**, Ed. Hopper, 1940, Oil on canvas, 22 3/16 x 25 1/8 in.">}}

Now that we have a reasonable introduction to the man, onwards to his enthralling works.  

## SIGNATURE FEATURES AND ELEMENTS   

Hopper's paintings, especially, his city studies, grant us a unique, voyueristic, almost intruder's perspective to peer into the lives of psychologically solitary figures. Someone on the internet said, "You can sleep inside an Edward Hopper painting". Rightfully. The serene calmness of his painting, almost eerie tranquility and choice of a handful of figures give his painting a kind of vast metaspace for the viewer to reach in and explore. Take _Western Motel, 1957, Oil on canvas, 30.25 x 50.125 inches_ and _People in the Sun, 1960, Oil on canvas, 40 x 60 inches_.   

<!-- Western Motel figure -->
{{<figure src="/img/hopper/0.jpg" caption="**Western Motel**, Ed. Hopper, 1957, Oil on canvas, 30.25 x 50.125 inches">}}

Sharp perspective, crisp straight lines, vast spaces, huge window, the play of light and shadow and in the center of it, a blonde woman in red staring straight at the viewer. This painting represents almost all elements that came to be known as signature Hopper realism &mdash; sometimes carelessly termed "Hopperesque", in his later work.  

Almost perfect "realist" perspective of objects, slightly utopic; house walls without blemishes or moss outgrowths, roads and streets perfectly paved without a scar or imperfection. _High Noon, 1949, Oil on canvas, 28 x 40 inches_ and _Cape Cod Morning, 1950, Oil on canvas, 34 x 40 inches_ helpfully illustrates these qualities.  

{{<figure src="/img/hopper/1.jpg" width="450px" caption="**High Noon**, Ed. Hopper, 1949, Oil on canvas, 28 x 40 in.">}}

### Solitary figures  

Solitary figures are suspended in a frozen melancholic mood, as if they want to say so much yet they just exist. Direct, fixating gaze is also dramatically observed in _Office at night_ where the secretary is looking at us with her upper body turned as her dress glaringly accentuates her figure. People in his painting are alone, terribly alone and contemplative. Perhaps the most famous of these people would be the lonely man in _Nighthawks_, donning a navy coat and a hat, with his back turned towards the audience as he sits solemnly at a New York diner late at night. Even in _New York Movie_, (one of my favourites), a painting of a theater's interior with many people, he creates a magical portrayal of a sad and aloof lady, hands on her cheek, distant from the pandemonium and chattering of people. We forget about the theater and are somehow drawn towards her inspite of the opulence and happenings. Her mere appearance evokes sympathy in our hearts.  

{{<figure src="/img/hopper/2.jpg" width="500px" caption="**New York Movie**, Ed. Hopper, 1939, Oil on canvas, 32.25 x 40.125 in.">}}

Another of my favourite is _Night windows, 1928, Oil on canvas, 29  34 inches_, an intimate moment of a lady from a intrusive, almost voyueristic perspective. Further examples may be given of _Evening wind, 1924, Etching, 67/8 x 81/4 inches_, a nude in bed who is staring out the window as a brisk wind unfurls the curtains or _Summer Interior, 1909_, another of my favourite, a partial nude with head hung low and deep in thought against the side of her bed. _Automat, 1927_ (a semi-favourite), _Moonlight Interior, 1921-1923_ and _Girl on Sewing Machine, 1921_ are also often cited.  

{{<figure src="/img/hopper/5.jpg" caption="**Automat**, Ed. Hopper, 1927, Oil on canvas, 28.125 x 36 in.">}}

### Couples  

Couples also feature in Hopper's imaginative universe, but only as symbolic companions to each other. There is little intimacy or romance depicted. Nobody ever makes contact with anybody else. Hands on head (in distress?), nonchalantly looking out the window seemingly oblivious to the presence of their partner, coolly dozing with the back turned towards others, these couples are representative of Hopper's personal experiences with romance and intimacy. In _Summer Evening, 1947_, a young couple, against glaring electric light are seen engrossed in a tussle, physically apart from each other, a conflict between themselves, a conflict within themselves? Their expressions and postures are forlorn and... quiet.  

{{<figure src="/img/hopper/8.jpg" caption="**Summer Evening**, Ed. Hopper, 1947, Oil on canvas, 30 x 42 in.">}}

Or _Room in New York, 1932, Oil on canvas, 29 x 36 in._ (my favourite), we catch a young couple in visible agony as they are struggling to fulfill their relationship somehow, the young man intensely reading the newspaper and the lady, a distance apart, head bowed low, mindlessly striking a key at the piano and contemplating her life. The intrusive, almost voyueristic window perspective that we see them through makes us feel like we are prying into the personal affairs of two people but then how many people openly acknowledge they are in a failing marriage? 

{{<figure src="/img/hopper/9.jpg" width="500px" caption="**Room in New York**, Ed. Hopper, 1932, Oil on canvas, 29 x 36 in.">}}

More instances can be seen in _Cape Cod Evening, 1939, Oil on canvas, 30 x 40 inches_, _Second Story Sunlight_, _Sunlight on Brownstones, 1956_, _Seawatchers, 1952_, _Summer in the City, 1949_, _Excursion into Philosophy, 1959_ and _Hotel by a railroad, 1952_  

### Light and shadows 

Figures staring out huge windows at bright, sunlit, almost delectable outside environments. _Sunlight in a Cafeteria_, _Second Story Sunlight_, _Morning in a City_, _Morning Sun_, _Cape Cod Morning_, _High Noon_, _A Woman in the Sun_. 

{{<figure src="/img/hopper/14.jpg" caption="**Sunlight in a Cafeteria**, Ed. Hopper, 1958, Oil on canvas, 40 3/16 x 60 1/8 in.">}}

### Sunlight 

_Rooms by the Sea_, 1951, _Sun in an Empty Room_, 1963 and the beautiful _Railroad sunset, 1929, Oil on canvas, 35 x 60 inches_. I have always loved the sun!  

{{<figure src="/img/hopper/10.jpg" caption="**Rooms by the Sea**, Ed. Hopper, 1951, Oil on canvas, 29.5 x 40 in.">}}

### Closed interiors  

House interiors, closed compartments like train coachs (_Night on the El Train_, _Compartment C Car_, _Chair Car_), lobbies (_Hotel lobby_), and rooms (_Hotel by a Railroad_, _Hotel Window_, _Hotel Room_) of course.  

{{<figure src="/img/hopper/11.jpg" width="500px" caption="**Night on the El Train**, Ed. Hopper, 1918, Etching on copper, 7.5 x 8 in.">}}

Working as an illustrator, Edward Hopper himself took the El Train back to his house. Paintings like "Night Windows" among many others certainly seem inspired by his observations from the train's window. In this etching, he represents the pain and loneliness experienced by a big city dweller.   

### Architecture  

_House by the railroad_, _Room for Tourists_, 1945. _Cold Storage Plant_, 1933, _Lighthouse Hill_, 1927 and _City Roofs_, 1932.  

{{<figure src="/img/hopper/13.jpg" width="400px" caption="**City Roofs**, Ed. Hopper, 1932, Oil on canvas, 29 x 36 in.">}}
{{<figure src="/img/hopper/12.jpg" caption="**House by the Railroad**, Ed. Hopper, 1925, Oil on canvas, 24 x 29 in.">}}

<!-- ## Nighthawks   -->

<!-- Nighthawks
E. Hopper was a New York artist. His paintings explore the city and beyond. He painted Nighthawks just before the bombing which meant the New York at that time was under constant bombing fears, public lights were dimmed and the city streets grew dark and...silent. The street outside the diner is desolate as well. The four figures are caged inside a metaphorical glass jar. All, inspite of their proximity, in a different world psychologically. The couples are not touching each other, like in almost all of Hopper paintings, and there are no eye contacts. The disconcerting nature of these people catches the viewer's attention so dramatically. The painting stands for the loneliness in a big city like New York and the enigmatic, lonely man seated with his back towards us is representative of that. Even though, we can't see him, he constitutes an imposing figure, drawing us towards him almost making us go inside and ask him that why he is melancholic.  -->
