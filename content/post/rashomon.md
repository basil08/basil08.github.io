When it was released, he observes, nobody had ever seen anything like it.
It was the first use of flashbacks that disagreed about the action they were flashing back to.
Because we see the events in flashbacks, we assume they reflect truth. But all they reflect is a point of view, sometimes lied about.
Many films that use a flashback only to fill in information are lazy.

Kurosawa observes in his autobiography, "Human beings are unable to be honest with themselves about themselves. They cannot talk about themselves without embellishing."

Although the stories are in radical disagreement, it is unlike any of the original participants are lying for their own advantage, since each claims to be the murderer.

Perhaps the emotions evolved in that forest clearing are so strong and fearful that they cannot be translated into rational explanation.
Eg: the woman taunting the two men (WOODCUTTER STORY)
Eg: Swordfight (BANDITS STORY)

elevated emotional level of the actors.
But Kurosawa was not looking for realism.
struck by the honesty of emotion in silent films, where dialog could not carry the weight and actors used their faces, eyes and gestures to express emotion.
plays well here because many of the sequences are, essentially, silent. Also seen in Seven Samurai

some viewers have treated Rashomon as a puzzle to be solved, insisting that there must be one true account we can discover if we sort the clues carefully enough. For others, like Pauline Kael, Rashomon is “the classic film statement of relativism, the unknowability of truth”. There is no definitive truth and no one was lying, they were only recalling the events through their subjective perceptions of them.


Setting: At the Rashomon gate, time hangs heavily. It is dead, empty, and idle. In the forest, time is charged with passion and anxiety, with life and honour at stake.

This obscurity of literal meaning has prompted symbolic interpretations”, argues Alexander Sesonske. “The most plausible of these sees Rashomon as an allegory of Japanese history, with its recurrence of Japanese culture being destroyed by barbarians, with hope for the future of Japan seen in the appearance of the baby at the end, an interpretation supported, perhaps, by the fact that the western music dominant through the film is replaced by traditional Japanese music at the close.”

The sequence is composed of fifteen shots, all of which are tracking shots, so that it becomes “an extended essay on the capabilities of the moving camera”.

By the time the shooting of Rashomon was finished at the forest near the Komyoji temple outside Kyoto, Kurosawa went to pay his respects to an abbot. The abbot told him in grave seriousness, “To be honest with you, at the outset we were very disturbed when you went about cutting down the temple trees as if they belonged to you. But in the end, we were won over by your wholehearted enthusiasm. ‘Show the audience something good.’ This was the focus of all your energies, and you forgot yourselves. Until I had the chance to watch you, I had no idea that the making of a movie was a crystallization of such effort. I was very deeply impressed”.

The woodcutter adopting the baby and the dialogue with the commoner: these actions shouldn’t be only viewed as general statements on the possibility of hope and goodness, but rather they must be considered within their characters’ narratives, as attempts to deal with the unbearable burden of guilt.
