> Yes, turn down the music  
Throw away the booze and   
Tell them the party's over for  
she isn't here.   
> Rip the sky bleed,  
crush every skull I find,   
burn every fucking flower    
that blooms coz I want her.    
> Yes, turn down the music  
Throw away the booze and   
Tell them the party's over for  
she isn't here.  
> Was it so much to ask for your love?  
I dreamt too much about us  
But you were too conceited. Now,  
Switch off the lights     
> And, turn down the music  
Throw away the booze and  
Tell them the party's over for  
she isn't here.    
&mdash; b.l.
