"It's such a beautiful day" opens with an innocuous and simple scene. Bill, the protagonist is walking down a road, watches a person approach him who might be a stranger, Bill has no idea. Their eyes meet and Bill wants to say something, but words are so muddled in his head and in the haste and spontaneity of the moment, he only manages to say a meaningless phrase "How's up?" mixing "How are you?" with "What's up?" to which the person is visibly confused and mutters a "Thanks". Their paths have crossed. They turn their heads to catch each other once again and Bill finally says "Weh" until they both know its over and none can make any meaningful conclusion of the entire encounter. No one stops and they continue on their paths, never to meet each other ever again.

This opening scene lays the foundation of what is to follow. Clocking at just 62 minutes, the movie is an experimental tour de force following the life of a young man named Bill and his descent into mental deterioration narrated in third person. But, do not mistake this for any other movie on mental health. It explores an unpopular way of storytelling namely via drawn comic strips and there are minimal dialogues. The flow of the movie is entirely achieved by the voice of a narrator (Don Hertzfeldt himself) who describes each situation in great detail for us. The animations are moving comic strips like the ones in kindergarten flipbooks and there are very few shots of real humans. There are long elaborated shots of epileptic and violent flashes of light, the ones that Bill himself experiences while slipping into dementia and is an ingenious concept on Don's part to put us into Bill's shoes in these instances.

The movie is anything but for kids. There are considerable instances of gore and grosteque details which are further detailed in the narration, especially of people being run over by train (multiple times), people catching on fire or boxer getting their heads split open in a particularly violent sparring round. Descriptions of images like grandmothers tossing their grandsons in the fireplace or measuring how far she can swing him are disturbing and made more so by the annoyingly monotonous and calm narrative voice used by Don just as if he was talking about some other banal aspect of life.

The banality of life forms such an important theme through the movie.
