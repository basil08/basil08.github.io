## sidenotes   

Posting some of my silly drawings here because [a good friend][0] said I should so oh well! It's painful to watch his blog go unnourished like this but I'm constrained by my physical limitations of being a human and being unable to transcend and/or manipulate the fourth dimension of time.   

Enjoy the comic until next time!
