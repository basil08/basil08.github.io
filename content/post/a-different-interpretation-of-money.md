Everyone would want to do things they wanted. 
Most would want to sing and dance, overeat, and have sex. Basically be merry and happy till death arrives.
Others would want to pursue weird "unprofitable" professionals/passions like full time bird watcher or anthropologist, stuff like that. Things that ain't valuable to other people


Let's go back. Way before money was invented. Beginning of civilization.
How did people survive? They have to _do work_. Pick berries, kill animals, make clothes, these kind of chores/hard work. You'd survive iff you work, irrespective of resources (which you had to win over other people in, say, a duel, another form of work). 

How different is society today?
No different. We have codified _working_ into money. Immaterial tokens agreed upon by a majority to be valuable. A storehouse of value. In theory, money possessed by a person proportional to the work the person does (work is defined in a different sense here, see below). Does it actually happen? No. Hence, absurd income inequalities. How can I say that? Simply because the sum total of a person's productivity is constrained by time. It doesn't justify the crazy inequalities we are seeing these days.   

Work is not physical work. Mental work too. In fact, most exponential productivity rise we have seen in previous decade has arisen from bridging the time people need to get their work done. This is a far-reaching statement. In fact, taken to the limit, this statement holds the key to essentially toppling the concept of value on which the entire institution of money is based on.   

Let me explain:
Do we really want money? No. What we want is the stuff that money buys. Material such as car, house, etc. or abstract provisions like freedom, etc. But who makes those stuff? People! Imagine, if we can delegate someone to do _all_ our work for us. People will argue we can't create raw resources (and that's true and the core reason for inflation but that is missing the point I'm trying to convey here). In a world where people get ample of what they deserve, would money hold any meaning? No. Would it be the utopia we have dreamt of? No. Far from it. Think about how quickly such a system would degenerate into chaos and unsurprisingly total annihilation for the whole species. Why? Because people are inherently greedy. We have never understood the concept of "enough" because it's engrained in our genes. When there is a resource you want and it's available in ample, stock as much as possible, even _more than you really need_ because you dont't know when it might become scarce. Not our fault, millions of years of evolution.   

Anyway, the point is computers and the internet are inventions that have made humans/people in general more productive in the sense that they have reduced the time needed to perform the tasks they generally need a lot of time doing before the invention of computers. 


PS: That's a lot of bullshitting from me.
