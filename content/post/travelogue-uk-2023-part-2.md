# Day 3 (21st December) 

Long walk and bathing. Made hot chocolate which was decent. 

Breakfast. 

All onboard and the conversation on the bus with Beck.

Alight and adieu

The detective story at entering Osney Arms 

The indecisiveness and rush of booking train tickets from OXF to BTH

Getting to the railway station 

Train journey to Bath 

The walk to the Roman Bath and eating at McDonalds

Fucking internet.

Pretty pretty festive season. The city centre. 

Walking down the streets of Bath to find a pub. Honing my Google Maps Navigation skills. 

Finding The Raven and The Grape (omg the vibes). Don't drink and justification for that? 

Going back to Oxf in search of a pub. 

Settling down to have dinner around 10. 

Just hanging out on the streets with Gokhe sir. 

Going to sleep around 12? 

Day 4 (Touring OXF and going to London)
 
Walking and vibing around Regent street

Day 5 (London core)

Day 6 (Bye bye UK)



Past few days of ideas big and small
