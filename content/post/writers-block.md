## Abstract :coffee:    

I crack my fingers, put on some rock music on my phone, heave a reminiscient sigh, and start typing on my laptop. Only to cringe at my writing after 30 minutes and send the article straight to the `/drafts` folders A.K.A. the "articles graveyard". I have around 10-12 pending articles resting peacefully in the `/drafts` folder which I look back to and tell myself "One day..." knowing it deep down that that's not gonna happen. The last post on this blog is dated Jun 21st. Inspite of promising myself atleast one article a month, because of college, I have failed to deliver.   

This post is a personal, meta post trying to investigate and identify what went wrong and how to recuperate.

## The quest for perfectionism :dart:   

It all starts with perfectionism, I suppose. Or my silly little need to be :sparkles:perfect:sparkles:. The "Breathless" post I wrote drew attention of a considerable number of people. I even got an interviewer tell me that he had seen Breathless ~50 times but couldn't understand it and after having read my article (I conveniently linked my blog in my resume), it finally made sense to him. I was flattered and all, sure. But, I realised then that I cannot publish anything lacking in quality than that post. I had inadvertently set a standard for myself. Kinda shot myself in the foot there because the idea was **to keep writing**. It is paradoxical how I stopped writing on this blog because I wanted to be perfect (or tend towards it). Eh, so much for being human. I guess, this is what is called a full-blown case of **acute writer's block**.   

Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not wasting my time if I'm not researching about some neo-classical artist, or writing tech articles on the lastest JS framework (which happens to be a rather [prolific field][2] :stuck_out_tongue:).    

I am a sophomore now. Life has taken a dramatic turn. Waking up everyday, fighting that strong imposter syndrome, and dragging myself to classes. Keeping track of assignments and labs, clubs, social life, family, future, career, basketball, ~~hobbies~~, all I can do is crash into bed at 2am and wake up the next day to start over. It has been enthralling but consuming. To maintain a level head, battling panic attacks, etc. it has been quite a challenging time too uptil now.    

But you are not here to listen to my plights, are you? Have I been procrastinating? No and this I can say with certainty. It is always a lack of topics or ideas and never a lack of enthusiasm when it comes to this blog. It goes back with me a long time :).      

## Why now? :thinking: 

I visited Ani's blog and realised that my life cannot be as demanding as his, right? And if he can maintain such a decent blog ([and I kid you not][0]) then why can't I? So yeah, FOMO got me considering again. And he made me realise what I had forgotten &mdash; I don't have to be the best all the time. It's okay if it's not well-researched, or "sloppily" written. It's all about those delta positives that adds up.   

I have never been able to decide what this blog covers, inspite of [having been interviewed][1] on this LMAO. Is it a personal blog? Is it a tech blog? Is it a philosophy blog? Or just my rant-vent? That might be part of the problem too, you see. I had always wanted to keep this blog informal. A conduit to project my personal life to the world but then that started causing problems, something I wasn't ready for yet. So, I decoupled that and I now journal anonymously on a different website. Then, I decided maybe a informal tech blog would do it. But I am involved in so many other interesting stuff that it just felt unfair. After "Breathless", I figured this will be my pristine blog where I showcase some of my finest literary accomplishments ~~or my paraphrasing skills~~. But hah, here we are!    

PS: I still write about films on my movies blog which I won't share because it has some of my unpolished works. Oh, lord, the perils of having set a benchmark for oneself and the paranoia of being judged!      

This blog started to document my life and serve as something I look forward to, take responsibility for, and hopefully feel proud about in the future. It was also a way to kill time because not a lot happened in those JEE years. But here, I'm a [journalist][4] at [BSP][3], writing more than ever (the small wins?), developer at [DevClub][5] :tada:, and executives in a couple of other places. I'm into quizzing and basketball too. So, it's not that things are not happening to me but rather, a lot of things are happening to me now XD.   

## And why _now_? :clown:   

I have two exams tomorrow and I really don't feel like studying. It's just something I do. I slept all day and studying just doesn't feel like it would do me any good now (and yet, I _know_ that it would) ARGH! It's a losing battle but I certainly shouldn't be here resuscitating my blog.   

## What next? :rocket:   

I have been working on a couple of interesting ideas at the moment which will take shape full-fledgedly after minor exams. I have been redesigning [fitoor][6] to serve as a one-stop service for _all_ my blogging needs (read: tantrums). Also, designing a portfolio webpage. Intend to move this away from GH pages. Looking to finish a project, I and a friend started. It might be a service some of you will be interested in. Will keep you posted! :P   

I read Ani's post on building a P2P network using UNIX sockets and I felt...reawakening. So, I dusted my Beej socket notes and am toying with the idea of a **distributed computing system**. Think of a distributed computer that speeds up your computation in return for your ideal computing resources. (There has to be some kind of a credit system to represent a transaction? Or maybe I'll think about this aspect later. The idea is to implement a system that would enable nodes to compute faster. My focus is on designing the delegation, integrity, and optimization aspects of the system more.) Will have to reach out for help on this.    

Intend to paint my hostel room. I have a couple of ideas too. I have watched around 80 movies in 2022 so far. I intend to go for FRI next year so prep for that. Courses on NPTEL and stuff. And oh, this idea about NFTs. ;)    

So long.
