_WARNING: Literally the entire story is told. Proceed at your own risk._

## TLDR   

If you plan to read it, you should look somewhere else.  

I **will** keep it somewhere deep in my "Never to Read Again" stack and hope it disintegrated that way.

## Yucks

### **References!**  

Apparently, we humans think that if something works for once than by extension **more** of it, no wait **way more** of it must be somehow better. And that is exactly the philosophy that the author has adopted while writing this sequel.   

If there is one thing that is abundant in this novel, it's references, of course. Obscure and famous, intriguing and plain bore, it's all meticulously documented in Ernst Cline's much awaited sequel to the super cool, super geeky novel Ready Player One (which I lovingly call RP1). RP1 had it's own share of 80s videogames references but RP2 takes it way further. Expect videogames, songs and freaking movie dialogue sequences quoted all out by Cline (This is when I started rolling my eyes) to breath life to a limpering story to which I shall proceed presently.   


### Stinky Plot

What does Cline have in store for us this time around? You guessed it, _another hunt_ concocted by the eccentric computer prodigy, social loser and OASIS creator James Donovan Halliday. Well, tested formulations tend to work (a reason why almost all movies out there seems strikingly similar in spirit) but this is also one of its perils. But RP1 deserved much more than Cline choose to give it. Personally, I expected more from RP2 after the deep place RP1 made for itself in my heart. And it's all painfully slow, the hunt I mean. Wandering around the OASIS, on a mission to awaken a copy of kira's consciousness inside the OASIS. Oh, and for all out spoilers, Halliday also figured out general AI _and_ a non invasive BCI that made users experience by sending signals to their cerebral cortex which he called ONI aka OASIS Neural Interface. This is perhaps the only innovation Cline happens to conjure in the sequel and literally drag it through with ONI, treasure hunt and references periodically introspecting on the events of RP1 for ripe nostalgia's sake. At some point, it becomes super incredible boring mirroring starking the basic skeleton of the first novel and giving me no real incentive to continue further. There I said it.

Wade becomes a billionaire and sure enough, loses his mind. Exploiting his money and new found OASIS powers and yada yada. Arty portrays her responsibility, maturity and righteousness. She, eventually, dumps him (rightfully so). Shoto and Aech are busy with their new lives too. Wait, Wade, Shoto and Aech are pooling resources to build a spaceship to travel to Proxima Centauri with a copy of the OASIS called ARC@DIA with human embryos. Seriously, this should have been left for Interstellar. 

And just like that, they reunite and are thrown into another hunt around the OASIS time bounded by 12 hours. The backstory behind this time limit is so ridiculous I'm sure Spielberg is not gonna buy it (I pray he doesn't. I don't want to see this absurdity on screen). A half formed consciousness of Halliday's brain has abducted Og and crafted Sorrento's escape to blackmail the High Five to bring him the Siren's soul which, FYI, is Kira's consciousness created by the insensitive Halliday without her permission. When I read it, I felt all of it might still make some sense but now as I'm writing, I think that's just a thought.  

### Unbalanced pace of storyline  

The story literally strolls through the initial half of the book, making it a difficult job to carry on. We are told that Wade has become a total dork and the billionaire syndrome that ensues and I personally hated that character development. I think (well, thought that is) Wade was much smarter and mature to have won Sam and the OASIS in RP1. For God's sake, single-handedly orchestrating and infiltrating IOI was nothing short of heroic inspite of being shut in that reinforced hotel room leaving behind his identity and friends in the aftermath of her aunt's assassination. Wade had substance but alas, Cline saw it otherwise. He turned Wade into _the very incarnation_ of the person I last expected him to become. And I hated it. 

Aech and Z spends soooo much metered time on the "Afterworld" doing completely weird meaningless shit like collecting artefacts to persuade NPCs who'd help them fight the seven Prince NPCs in an epic promised battle that apparently only Aech was excited about. Only it didn't end that way...at the end of the "glorious" battle, both Parzival and I were equally confused as to who actually won. It was ridiculous and definitely not hilarious. At this point, I was reading only to make it to the end as soon as possible. 

During the Quest for the Sixth Shard on Arda I, Cline gladly spares an entire paragraph to describe to us in vivid detail the ferocity of Morgoth, the invulnerable and blah blah. Morgoth was literally supposed to be the bad guy who couldn't be defeated. Probably, I have read more superlatives in this book than all the others I have read _combined_. At least, I had hoped this will be respected but I knew I was in deep shit already. The epic battle was literally wrapped up in four lines with Arty casting a sleep spell, Z yanking out the gem and both of them heading straight for the exit. There was not even a _hello_ from Morgoth, let alone a battlecry dialogue. This is next level imbalanced narration. 


After the Shards are assembled and Kira's AI copy is awakened, she hands Z the Rod of Resurrection. He brings Og back to digital consciousness and he reunites with Kira aka Leucosia. Sure enough. Then all of a sudden, he revives Samatha's grandmother. WTF?   

### Wade, Sam and ehm..their romance  

There is absolutely nothing significant here. The author forcibly tries to somehow align them and amalgamate their hearts together for whatever twisted reason he had. There was no reason for this after the much prominent dumping side story that he chose to tell in the beginning. There is no mature conversation or intimate moments shared. In a way, Sam is forced to love back Wade after he proved that he's still the nerd he was by flexing his trivia wisdom and few eye contacts. This is almost as trash as Anorak suddenly turning out to be the good AI who _actually_ didn't intend to hurt anyone and was bluffing all along. Is this how one chooses to hinge the central vehicle of suspense that drives the story? A bluff? And for the record, the great Parzival didn't crack the first Shard puzzle. He _paid_ a smart girl $1B to do it for him, mega bad corporate style. Totally mindless, reckless and incompetent.   

## Ok, I have to say something good too  

I didn't absolutely despised RP2 though it did succeed in ruining all the glorious expectations I had of it. Take for instance the Bono reference that I absolutely did not see coming and which hit me like a breaking wave :P Then we get to glimpse Holden's Field and the Cliffs of Salinger :D    

Needless to say, this book like it's predecessor is a literal trove of references if you wanna soak in one. Of course, I was born decades after the time it chooses to tell the stories about so I rely on the web and dig out artifacts from digital documents, Wikipedia articles, old movies, songs, games. I feel like an archaeologist discovering a slightly more polished gem everytime I look, evidences of the history written by people gone by and the days they lived. It's an amazing feeling. For starters, I finally watched Tron after the needed nudge and will watch "Some Kind of Wonderful" (hopefully). Cline drops song references generously throughout the book and to be honest, it does make an intriguing playlist. But I'm probably saying that because I have nothing else to say.

## Closing thoughts   

I thought Cline would craft a jaw droppingly unique adventure, one that will be subtle and imposing that after it will be over, I'd still be under its daze for a long time. And that's all I'm disappointed about. I'm to blame somewhere myself for having read this inspite of all the warning out here on the Internet. I'll pretend this sequel never existed.
