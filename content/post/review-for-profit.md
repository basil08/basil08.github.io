_For Profit_ is a detailed exploration of the history of corporations and accompnaying structures that enabled the corporation to flourish and become an integral part of every facet of modern human society.   

It talks about innovations and discoveries through the centurie, tracing right from the times of Caesar, through mediaval Florence, Elizabethan England and so on to weave a complete picture of the powerhouse that corporations have become and the centerplace that they occupy in the political, social, and of course, economical landscape of nations.   

The story of corporations is the singular story of profit-seekers at the cost of anything. But to coat the realities in such a succint, albeit true, statement is a disgrace to the innovation and tyranny that such structures have wrecked on our societies and will continue to do so in the future. Take for instance, the case of the East India Company, an innocuous band of merchants who sought profits for themselves and eventually grew into a militiarized powerhouse, destabilized the rulers of another country (at the cost of massacres and famines), and assumed governance of another country - a role not traditionally associated with any corporation. We don't see Tesla colonizing countries today to sell their cars or give themselves legal right to collect taxes (These propositions are extremely unlikely anyway given the checks and balances we have evolved by mistakes such as the East India Company). But it is terrifying to comprehend a company with the original objective of "bringing glory and prosperity to our motherland" amassing political and military power and asserting itself as an equal to the government itself. Even more fascinating is the study of these corporations in finding themselves in increasingly able positions to influence external politics and social phenomena, take for instance, the Tea Act passed in haste by the British Parliament and lobbied by the Company to export tea to America without a duty. The result? An upheaval from the local tea-merchants, culminating the Boston Tea Party and the acceleration of the American migrants to identify themselves as a separate identity and declare their independence from the British Empire. At approximatey the same time, the subordination and negligence of Indians of Bengal by the company officials which led to the disastrous Bengal famine of 1770 drew criticism and loss of support from Britain's neighbors and American counterparts where revolutionary new ideas, by way of leading thinkers like Voltaire, Rosseau, and Robespeirre, such as individual liberty and rights, freedom of speech and expression, and universal freaternity were evolving.

The progression of corporations greatly mirrors humanity's understanding and innovative use of money not just as a medium of exchange but as an enabler. I think this will continue to do so in the future.   


I saw the painting of "The Last Spike" and was intrigued how the actual x miles of the transcontinental railroad was built by the sweat and tears of Irish labour and yet the "Golden Spike" was driven in by these neatly-dressed, aristocratically clad, flamboyant upper-class American capitalists like Leland stanford and Dr. Durant.
