On September 24th, 1994, the first episode of yet another sitcom aired on NBC. Revolving around the lives of six friends living in NYC, it instantly enraptured the audience. Ten years later, the final episode of _"Friends"_ was viewed by a whooping 52.5 million viewers in America _alone_, making it the fifth-most watched finale in television history. _Friends_ has received allocades and awards throughout its 10 year lifetime and is consistently included in the "most influential" television series list of many reputed critics. Even eighteen years after the finale, Friends is not out of vogue as it remains the most watched television series on Netflix in the UK and the second-most watched in the US. However, in this post, the author wishes to observe Friends from an oblique perspective and understand what underlaid the comedy and laughter; in essence, what makes Friends tick.   

Let's step back and ask what makes sitcoms in general appealing? Sitcoms (1) are an excellent vehicle for inclusion.  


It's okay to be surrogate, to adopt, or to be a co-parent. Monica-Richard stint (freedom to choose your partner).  

Rachel and feminism
- Manipulating Joey
- Alpha female at her job
- 

Phoebe 
Metaphor for hope
Has that tinge of evil.
The rolling stone, hippie with a class.
Mug, assassin, manhandled, dysfunctional family, and yet
found a way to do so many things in life.
guitar, star in a music video, smelly cat, surrogacy, multiple lovers, found the love of her life
The most badass friend

Ross
- Sacrificed his chance to star on TV to say with his ex because she wasn't feeling well. This man has a heart of solid gold.
- unagi, pivot, we were on a break!  

Chandler


Joey
promiscous, dumb, good heart
Joey doesn't share food
The friend who's always there. Stands firm with puffed chest at any request.


Monica

The least characterized friend. There are very few Monica things in the sense that there a lot of Phoebe or Joey things. 



Natural comedy:
Just when you need it, just in the right amount. Nothing feels pressured. Physical comedy. 

Appeal of sitcoms:

They give a seemingly disconnected audience to connect and identify with each other at some level. Members of two different communities may not have something common to share, agree, or emphatise over. Mass media alleviates that problem by providing a "common history" for these individuals to identify with.

Cult following: 
Dozens of references, from American food to television shows to movies to songs to celebritites. It was this that connected the show with the audience. Friends weren't in some disconnected universe from ours but in a world just like ours. 

(1): Any artistic medium really. Movies, books, artworks, music, and so on.
