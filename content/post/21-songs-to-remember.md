This blog post is inspired by a [post][0] by Bob Nystrom, a PL scientist, coding geek, and music aficionado - in short, one of my earliest idols. But unlike the pretty bland, "40 songs", title that Bob uses for his post, I sat wondering what I should call this post. The result, as you may see, is nothing fabulous.

However, the essence of this post remains the same. I turned 21 recently (a day back to be precise) and this post will list down 21 of my favourite songs that have shaped me into the person that I am today. 

Notes on mortality and death

I am not sure how one should be internalising birthdays and to be honest, the conventional agreed social behaviour appears to be counter-intuitive to me. Why would you be celebrating the nearing of your own death? Or perhaps, it is precisely because of that that you wish to celebrate to the fullest. Anyways, human reasoning is complicated and I have grown to believe almost _anything_ can be justified with a proper twisting of words given enough patience and time. In any case, I am twenty-one years old. It hits different when I say it out loud. _The twenties_.

Without further boring you with my lazy, half-assed attempts at being a philosophical genius, I'll start:
