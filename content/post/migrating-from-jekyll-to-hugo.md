_This is a quick note for the convenience of the readers._  

With a heave of pleasant sigh, I can inform you all that **I am migrating from [jekyll][0] to [hugo][1]**. Finally.   


The only hindrance (so to speak) was the choice of a decent theme which, as you can see, has been accomplished. Hugo has a ton of features and conveniences that I would be foolish to not take advantage of. Archetypes, built-in shortcodes, KaTeX typesetting, taxonomies beside being so fast! I love Hugo. :purple_heart:

### A word of caution :skull: 

It is quite obvious, migration is neither a quick nor an exciting task. This will take time. I plan to complete it in parts over multiple days. So don't freak out if some link is broken or you find _"gibberish text"_ written midway through a post. And, I am looking into alternatives to Disqus.   

To infinity and beyond. :rocket:
