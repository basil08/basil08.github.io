# Meta / Philosophy

The Responsibility of Intellectuals - On the Moral Judgement of helping out the world versus not giving a fuck
-> if everyone was aware of the pain and agony their existence costs other ppl, would they stop?
-> no. thus, pain and misery can never end. and that is nott the aim.
 
-> the pain of the maestro is caressed and pampered. what about the downtrodden and the miserable?


-> to reduce existing pain and misery because the curr state is far above acceptable thresholds



ASIDE IDEA: Nature of things (the underlying real meaning of things), form, and structure matter so much - a commentary on the importance of the abstract and the meta (meta learning)

# Pop Cult / Movies

Watching Requiem for the American Dream 

Constructs for movie review:

DDLJ first impressions

patriarchy

strongly steeped in Indian cultures (karwa chauth, marriage home, etc)

Raj's dad falls in love with Simran's bua (hyperrealisation of reality)

unwavering love of the heroine for the hero - misogynistic undertones (stems from patriarchy naturally, I Guess)

apna and paraya - moral conscious in terms of Indian and the Indian diaspora in the UK soil.

few swoon-worthy moments - the dinner in karwa chauth between Raj and Simran, Simran and her mother conversation moments 

Elopment as a central decision making problem


# Misc


Where is character and excellence? Putting up such wonderful character but when the veneer is pulled, most are just lying.
Dialogue between two friends on the idea behind money, work, productivity, economics, resources, value creation.
Humanity is doomed; capitalism forces us to produce what people want. money and economy and markets force ppl to care about others. no thought about the planet. not visible desctruction. irreversible when visible.
