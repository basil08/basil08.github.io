"How many times had she, Hasina, and Giti said those same three words to each other,
Laila wondered, said it without hesitation, after only two or three days of not seeing
each other?   
_I missed you, Hasina._ _Oh, I missed you too_. In Tariq's grimace, Laila learned
that boys differed from girls in this regard. They didn't make a show of friendship. They
felt no urge, no need, for this sort of talk. Laila imagined it had been this way for her
brothers too. Boys, Laila came to see, treated friendship the way they treated the sun: its
existence undisputed; its radiance best enjoyed, not beheld directly."    

~A Thousand Splendid Suns, Khaled Hosseini
