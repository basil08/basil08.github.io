{{<dropcap>}} Global {{</dropcap>}} news channels are keenly monitoring, with much bated breath, the development in the Indian subcontinent and the rise of fascist right-wing Hindutva in the country; the germ of discord and intolerance that were sown with the demolition of the Babri Masjid back in 1992. Rarely has the prime minister of any country made such a dramatic show of their support towards one particular religion. It is evident that the Modi government has piggybanked on the identity-based politics for its third run at the general elections later this year. 

## The imaginary nation 

A nation is bound together by a story shared by millions of people who _believe_ in it. India has become an experiment in what happens when a group of people try to poison that story by force. The last decade has seen mass hysteria; the condition when large groups of people are rendered mentally limp and agree to be led like a sheep, human idolisation, and a systemic departure from a rational and tolerant point of view. The target of this campaign has largely been uneducated or semi-educated youths who are financially vulnerable and are easier to convince of "the cause". 

## The spectrum at IITD

I was invited to be a part of the student jury which judged creative writing entries for NISHAAN, a fest for PwD students organised by the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, IIT Delhi. I read about ideas of inclusion and how it is important for the upliftment of society and it made me wonder that how distant and alien these ideas have become in present India. The whole affair was replete with irony because I witnessed a Ram mandir procession _inside_ the campus a few days after.

I saw bystanders staring uncomfortably at excited and passionate students and employees chanting "Jai Shree Ram"  (Long live Lord Ram), beating drums, and singing hymns on loud speakers wondering what it means for reason and rationality when a religious procession was allowed inside the campus when student protest against mess fees for instance, are met with unprecedented friction from the administration and security.

## The questions no one asked 

Why were the ID cards of students and employees in the procession not checked? Who verified that only IITD members were part of the procession? Which Dean approved the procession to take place in the first place? Why did the security team not complain of "excessive noise and disturbance, creating a nuisance" when the procession went past the library at peak office hours on Saturday? Why are none of these questions answered by the administration? And more importantly, _why are none of these questions asked?_

Why are the posters on hostel notice boards and 10 feet banners spewed across the campus not interpreted as "unfitting for an academic institution" while student survey on caste where taken down on grounds of being propagandist? I refuse to believe that the intelligentsia of IITD is so callous as to overlook this fact which brings me to the next logical deduction &ndash; that the intelligentsia approves of the majoritarian high-handedness of one particular group and their beliefs at the cost of others who are also residents of the same tapestry. And I think that is shameful. Where are the professors who profess of freedom of expression of opinions? Where are the student leaders of tomorrow? Who will be the enforcer of freedom and to live without fear when the enforcers refuse to do their rightful duties? 

## Paradise Lost?

When I came to IITD, I used to marvel at the rich tapestry of the university, it was supposed to be a confluence of so many cultures and I used to believe in the synergy of such ideas and the outcome of that energy. It breaks my heart to see the brightest minds in the country wasting their times in nurturing and propagating hatred towards "others". How can India innovate and progress and become a trillion dollar economy if we churn out workers and employees by our taxpayer's money? 

## Are the journalists not dead _yet_? 

I invited a number of eminent journalists, designers, and artists as part of Literati '24. Talking to them backstage corroborated the fact that journalists and whistle-blowers are _fearful_ to talk about blatant violation of the Indian consitution. One remarked how this idea of identification of which religion one belongs to is a recent import into the popular Indian mindset. Asmita Theatre Group performed a play at Literati called "Amritsar Aa Gaya" &ndash; a moving play based on the tensions in the aftermath of the partition. It made me cry.

There used to be no need to mention one's religion in any conversation but now, that seems to be the first thing that is asked or noted. It makes me wonder what happens to societies where the 4th pillar of democracy ceases to exist? When people empowered to start conversations refuse to speak up? 

## Law and Order (or lack thereof)

In complete defiance of the constitution, the Centre government has been appeasing the majority group at the cost of minorities. This giant propagandist machinery is crafted with treachery, cunning, and a complete disregard to dissent. The poster boy of this bull-dozering dismantling of the Indian tapestry is our charismatic prime minister himself. 

The end of democracy when dissidents fear to ask questions or raise questions lest they be labelled as "anti-nationals" and prosecuted. Naturally, dissidents will be forced _not_ to raise their concerns in the future when the state sets the precedence of not prosecuting violators of the Indian Constitution. Criminals who suppress past dissidence by force or bloodshed.

It might appear supremacist or satisfying but historically, the natural asymptote of a society based on hatred towards minorities is a complete breakdown of law and order and descent into an implosion and failure of society as a whole; it will not be too late until the hatred towards minorities is channelled towards anyone and everyone who dissents with the small group in power simply because hatred is never satisfied. In my opinion, what remains to be seen is how quickly this will be achieved in India. 

## Short-term appeasement is an age old trick 

Why are we not talking about societal welfare? Why are the news portals head over heels in love with the daily routine of our PM? Who will talk about Manipur? Or Israel? Or Canada? It seems like the Modi government has mastered a way to transiently gratify the masses by using underhanded tricks like declaring holidays on religiously significant days, aided by an army of "tech-savvy" internet censorship which aggressively takes down any dissent. But why to assume that the current policies are the best and there is no scope for improvement? If there is no dissent, then who will point out that the minorities are getting hurt? Aggression really seems to be the _modus operandi_ of the current government.

## Conclusion 

I wonder if Lord Ram Himself would be happy to see bloodshed in his name? Clearly, no God would want to see sleeping people dragged out from their homes in the middle of the night and harassed and butchered. Which God is so cruel as to want that? No, it is the hearts of men that are dark and their eyes that are blind. And they know nothing about religion who use it's name to profilerate their own greed and ambition. 

I don't expect this post to do anything really. Frankly, I'm just glad that you have the patience and reason to read upto this point (very very few people can do that). But to keep quiet is to be a part of the oppressors and I refuse to oppress. Maybe you can ask questions in your own little way?
