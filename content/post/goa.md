The guy who offered us a gf for 500 INR at the church parking lot

Got scammed by water sports guy 
Tasting menu
The altercation w the owner
Now know how they con and where
But the ride back was heavenly and lifted my mood again
Swimming with fishes and jellyfishes


The breath stopper ride from Karmali to Candolim

The instant mood uplift by the Candolim beach and the soft spoken receptionist Ashley 
10/10 recommend if you're unmarried/solo/student

Expensive food 600, 400, etc.

Everything is false. People are not happy but pretending to be.
People are more concerned about how they look in insta pics and not how they truly feel
Only money is real. That's how the world works/runs. A well oiled machine which can produce anything you wish - flesh or fashion, only if u have the greens to satiate it's hunger.

The injuries and the toppling experience at Candolim beach
3 times topple

Sad about the commercialization of the beauty of Goa

Got momentarily lost in the lanes of Goa beach near Baga beach - thrilling, the exposure to the elements, crabs, snakes, etc.


Phone screen cracked - on train, bad omen

The ethnicity - english ppl cheap beach alternative, 40+ old men and women half naked yuck
Indian newly weds
Rich ass family from Mumbai

The first night at the station, guy told don't trust anyone


Female TT - perhaps the only time I have ever seen one

Never have seen a train arrive ahead of time - always late - Indian mindset


How similar is Bombay and Calcutta cultures and history
