It's exactly 03:37 AM as I am writing this. ["Free Fallin'" by Tom Petty][0] blasting through my earphones. I feel enraged, suffocated and insanely alone. It's wonderful how I can identify these emotions because all I feel is numb.

So, there is this girl I met on Omegle. Oh, ["Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin][1] started playing.

Every individual of the opposite gender of my species that I have met have been terrible (Not many, FYI). Immature, myopic, reckless. Older girls are at least a reasonable voice to talk to. Maybe that partly justifies my fetish for older girls. Girls in my age group? I don't know and I'm not eager to find out. "...Our shadows taller than our souls. There goes the lady we all know..."

["Light My Fire" by The Doors][2] is on.

But this girl left me intrigued after our first conversation. She was the strange mix of snappy and rude and witty. Not the random dumbass getting-to-know-you chitchat. She worked up my brain and boy, did I love that. Anybody can stimulate my body. Stimulate my mind and you have my heart (Borrowed from another post I wrote). Bottom line, I had a crush on her.

We exchanged Insta IDs. A couple days back, she wanted "more of me". This girl has _weird_ mood swings. After some random BS, I texted, "Won't you ease my worried mind?" and she texted back "I tried to give you consolation". ["Tangerine" by Led Zeppelin][3] hits the floor. Hmm, good taste check. (Sidenote to self: Is one song enough to justify good taste? Probably not) Who cares? The girl has listened to Layla, my favourite (arguably, greatest) rock love song ever written.

Last midnight, we...(["Paradise City" by Guns N' Roses][4]. Hell, I love the chorus)...ended up doing the pandemic equivalent of singing along (that is, texting basically) the chorus of ["Truly Madly Deeply"][5]. That felt good. Oh, ["The Chain" by Fleetwood Mac][6]. She suggested ["Freaking Out on The Interstate"][7] (which as you know was my staple sometime back) which made her reconsider my marriage proposal :). Then, out of nowhere she got disappointed and took blame for the disappointment which cracked me up. I have no idea how the female mind works. Maybe Hawking was right all along. They will remain a complete mystery. But therein lies the beauty, isn't it?

["Sunday Bloody Sunday" by U2][8]..."So many lost but tell me who has won?" I wish I could frame Bono's voice.

Yesternight (technically), I met her television. Well, I genuinely missed her all day. But I understand, she has her obligations. ["The Boys of Summer" by Don Henley][18]. And then, she sent me her picture. Gosh, let no girl ever do that again, it melts my heart. I really mean: Do it every fucking time.

Am I infatuated? Nah, I'm sure. Love? WTF, brain. Stop.

Well, she told me she cannot commit if she ever really wanted to do it so that's that. ["Dream On" by Aerosmith][9]. Right, okay. _I am disappointed. A bit hurt too_. I just wanted her to care about me. I am not the pervert kind. "...Dream on, Dream on, Dream on, Dream on till your Dreams come true...". I have a certain class to myself and I expect such from my surroundings. I wished she could comfort me. ["Baba O' Riley" By The Who][10]. I love love love the outro on this song. Anyway, I don't know what I expect her to do. Or how I should behave. But, that night was good. You cannot show me something I need and tell me you don't give a shit. Yes, she is a happy coincidence I didn't plan for. ["All Along The Watchtower" by Jimi Hendrix][11]. How after a point, the human body stops responding to anguish and pain? I have reached that point. She may not be the girl who can comfort me but I wanted her to be. Okay, enough poetry shit. Expectations hurt.

The riff of ["Smoke on The Water" by Deep Purple][12] is booming loud.

Oh, great it's ["Paint It, Black" by The Rolling Stones][13]. Precisely the song I need.

["More Than a Feeling" by Boston][14]. "I closed my eyes and she slipped away".

Whatever, it is. I am glad I can talk to her. I don't want things to get messed up between us. I'll try my best till the end. But she has to do her part too. I wish I could hear her voice. ["Layla" by Derek and the Dominos][15]. I wish she was near me. Heck, I want to kiss her.... Fuck, okay. Enough. As you can see, I am quite fucked up at the moment.

"Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?"

["Once In A Lifetime" by Talking Heads][16]. This song is outright mind control. 5:01 AM. I want all these emotions to be preserved. I want to capture the fluids rushing through me. I want people to know I was here and that I was not perfect.

["Sweet Child O' Mine" by Guns N' Roses][17] is the last track.

5:20 AM. Another sleepless night. I can feel a migraine rumbling in the back of my head. And all I say to people when they ask "How are you?" is "I am okay".
