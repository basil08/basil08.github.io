I _love_ those wild internet surfing experiences when you just start somewhere and let yourself be lost down the rabbit hole. I recently discovered [this][0] aggregator site which curates random, interesting blogs, websites, and so on. One thing led to another and I found myself reading [Georges Perec's][1] incredible weird book, _"An Attempt At Exhausting A Place in Paris"_. (As a side note, if you know of any book that qualifies as "incredible" _and_ "weird", throw them this way!).  

who was georges perec 

_An Attempt_ is a 30-35 page booklet of an innovative and unique nature. It describes a certain locality in Paris as observed by the author sitting at a roadside cafe for 3 days. What saves the book from mediocrity and being branded as just another "observational" book, is its nature. Perec himself puts the objective of his study as follows, "what happens when nothing happens". Mundane everyday events, street signs and symbols that we ignore for the thousandth time, petty encounters, charming eye contacts, Perec brings to the forefront what our minds have pushed to the back &ndash; the beauty of plain existence. In an era of boggling globs of information for the brain to process, it is left with no choice but to optimize, to forgo of opportunities and curiosities that it kindled in its naive days and replace them with immediate professional occupancy. While reading _An Attempt_, you will be forced to abandon that mental stronghouse and embrace mundanities and trivialities and the reality of things as they are: the being. 

To take an analogy to its extreme, the book can be viewed as a journal writer's entry except that the writer is the place. It is amusing to imagine how much information we simply ignore and merely focus on that thin slice of reality that constitutes our experiences. Imagining people sitting in _every_ street cafe and recording _all_ events, how would that be? I suspect that won't constitute information because information should be organized and useful. Though, such records would be both but they would be at a higher more elusive level than the information we can comprehend or have been evolved to (I suspect the latter). In that mind numbing web of intricacies, our meagre lives would find no meaning but only the equivalent of a transitory flicker hence, driving our minds insane. Ignorance is the mind's way to safekeeping its sanity.
