In its attempt to impress everyone, the latest season of [_Sex Education_][0] falls straight on its face. Let me tell you why I feel so strongly for the series’s last (thankfully) instalment. 

## Incorrect perception 

SexEd started out as a unique and quirky series exploring teenagers of a fictitious town called Moordale and their sexual and personal lives. The plot was considerably involved with many moving pieces and yet secretly incorporated sex education and brought out some relevant taboos and problems surrounding sex. That was nice and welcomed by everyone. 

And then it just got worse. I’m not even going to touch the storyline and the multiple plots but by an extremely unsatisfactory season 3 climax, it was clear that the story had touched a ceiling and the only place for it to go was downward. 

And that is what season 4 is. It’s the jumbled and confusing mess that has flown from the ignorant (or arrogant?) pens of writers who refuse to accept that the wide spectrum of human sexuality is impossible to capture in a web series. In its attempt to appear accommodating and welcoming, SE goes on blabbering. 

## Incorrect social portrayal

SE opens with the OG group of problematic teenagers now shifted to Cavendish college - an ultra-left progressive school where one can find the most diverse identities on earth. This is the first instance when SE distances itself from reality. No such place exists on Earth. Moreover, these people somehow manage to live in a cooperative and harmonious environment. And that is…disturbing. That’s not a correct representation of how human groups exist. Violence and conflict can break out _even_ in groups of the same kind (to ghettoise horribly). You might say that these conflicts were shown later in the series but my point is that such huge differences, especially based on a sensitive metric like sexual identity, will never allow such communities to exist in the first place. 

## Repetitive patterns 

SE takes up its title too literally this season. You liked Otis as a sex therapist through S1, S2, S3? Guess what you’ll get this season? Two sex therapists! The entire season devolves into this overtly conspicuous pattern of addressing people’s sexual and social problems. As a bonus, you have to keep track of 5 such storylines in parallel. Notice how students just magically confide in their friends who they have literally just met. Otis and Eric were childhood friends and yet Eric somehow confided in Abbi. WTF? Why is this series so deliberately trying to be unrealistic (or is it trying to be funny?)

And then there’s some life-transforming event that happens - perhaps a conversation or someone’s death, and people again just magically understand and everything’s all fine and flowery again. Yay!

## Wasteful and consumerist 

Forget about sexual identities, let’s just talk about the portrayal of American teenagers in the series. That is clearly not how an average teenager lives (or wastes). There’s a very strong consumerist sentiment underlying the series portraying rich, wasteful teenagers in an environment clearly not the majority of us finds ourselves in. Was it trying to be deliberately insensitive? This is just very problematic.

Oh also, what’s up with Dolly and the tabs? Like you have a personalised social media hanging from your neck at all times in school? Seriously? I think they overdid the progressive college and ventured into outright nonsense for this one.

## Thank god, it’s over

I get that Sex Education is literally sex education but it all just seems too on the face. There’s no subtlety. At best, it’s pretentious, at worst, it’s irresponsible. I can’t make up my mind which is the worst.
