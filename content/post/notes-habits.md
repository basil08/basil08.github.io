## My Notes   

### Introduction 

* Majority fail in making habits because they try to make changes the wrong way.    

* It is easy to get obssessed with the result.   

* Never overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making better decisions on a daily basis.   

* **Don't focus on the destination. Focus on the path.**   

### Habits 

* Pattern of every habit:   
  * Reminder ( trigger )
  * Routine ( the action itself )
  * Reward ( the benefit )

* A good reminder makes it easier for you to start your habit by encoding your new behavior in something that you already do, rather than relying on getting motivated.   

* Set a visible reminder and link your new habit with your current behavior.  

* Reminders are specific to you and your habit.   

* Things that you do everyday without fail, even unconsciously.  

* "Make it so easy you can't say no" - Leo Babauta  

* **start small** 

* **consistency is key**   

* Reward yourself, atleast with positive self-talk.  

* Make habits that are important to you, not what you are told.  

### New Identity

* visualize yourself being the better you.  

* Grow more confident in your new identity by getting approval from others.  

* **All your actions is a reflection of who you think you are. Change your image and you change your habits.**   

### Motivation is unreliable 

* Define life-goals := tiny, daily behaviors that are repeated until success becomes inevitable.    

* **"Plant the right seed in the right spot, it will grow without further coaxing..."**

* "Focusing on motivation as the key to habits is exactly wrong..."   

* "Pick the right small behavior and sequence it right."   

* Don't dive into the deep end and drown as the initial impetus fades.   

* Dream big, but start small.

### Just Do it 

* The problem: We set deadlines, not schedules.  

* If we don't achieve, we feel like failure - even if we improved.   

* **It's not about always doing your best work, it's about doing the best you can on a consistent basis.**  

* Stop focusing on result. Focus on consistency.  

* Don't refrain when the Muse sings to you. But don't rely on them.   

* The focus is on doing the action, not achieving X goal by a certain date.  

### Keystone Habits  

* **A keystone habit is a behavior that naturally pulls the rest of your life in order.**  

* Eg: Fitness, Work out, morning run, daily meditation.  

### Get back on track (quickly)

* Best strategy isn't to avoid failure, it's to plan for it.   

* Must have a plan to get back on track _before you get off track_.  

* Be specific about your habits. **When, where, exactly how are you doing to do it?**

* **Stick to your schedule, even in small ways.**  

* This will prove to yourself that you can achieve even when the circumstances are not favorable.  

* Have a person as an incentive.  

* Design your environment for success.  

### Overcome Bad Habits ASAP  

* Bad habits are a way of dealing with stress and boredom.    

* **Bad habits can't be eliminated. They must be replaced.**  

* Choose a substitute that provides a similar benefit.  

* Cut out as many triggers as possible.  

* Join forces with somebody.  

* Visualize yourself succeeding.  

* You lived without the bad habit before. If you could then, then you certainly can now.  

* Be aware of your bad habits.   

* It takes perseverance but it isn't impossible.  

### Conclusion

* **Knowledge is useless without action.**
