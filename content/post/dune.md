Themes:

ecology and environment 

mysticism and superstition- the idea of precognition, soothsayer, of being able to see things that are hidden in space or time, of being inaccessible is an idea that has seduced man's imagination since time immemorial. natural extension of this anatomical privilege is exhibited in the social fabric that consitutes the world of dune, and oh, such a vibrant world it is - filled with groups that specialise in groups of work - mentats, txilau, ix, richesse, producers, harkonnens, guilders, sarduakars, etc. 

superstition - a world rooted in falsity and fake promises appear enticing to men when reason has broken down - the end of the computing era (Butlerian Jihad). 

bene gesserit's breeding program - power lies with those who can control birth? the choice to give life? 

linguistic influences - arabic, sanksrit, hebrew, latin, 

religious influence - islam, judaism, christianity, other pagan religions, hinduism, buddhism, and much more

love the lessons of statesmanship, cunning, and state politics, of psychology, and strategy so meticulously concealed within the prose. the stories of the royal families and the Houses especially.

notes


loved the dinner party at the Arrakeen House by Leto and Jessica. it teaches us so much so effectively.


hated how they reduced Liet Kynes's role in the Denis Villenueve movies. Turned him into a character of convenience although he seems to command more respect (and paper) in the books.
