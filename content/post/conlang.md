Lately, I have been thinking a lot about the nature of languages and the field of linguistics. Despite being the backbone of civilization, language remains an artificial construct. That's what makes it so interesting. What went inside the minds of those people who first defined a language? Where did they start? How are the prevalent modern languages inadequate? And most importantly, how can they be improved upon?    

It's surprising how most people take such fundamental things for granted, partly because they are _fundamental_ and hence cannot be tampered or challenged; done and dusted as they say. But it doesn't hurt to understand how we got here. In this post, I will outline how to construct a practical human language, just like English or German, which will serve all purposes expected of a language. For more, you can check out this [course on MIT OCW][0].   

These languages, called "ConLangs" for constructed languages, are more common than you might think. Perhaps, the more famous examples would be Esperanto, Klingon, and Tolkien's Elvish. Apart from serving in literature and pop culture, linguistic studies cross paths with computer science in the construction of semantics and grammar for computer programming languages and raises philosophical questions on the nature of language and so forth. [Obfuscated languages][1] such as [Brainf*ck][2], and so on.  

## Purpose and Philosophy of a Language  

The purpose of a language guides the philosophy. And the entire grammar of that language rests on that philosophy.  

The ubiquitous algorithm to engineer any system is to first define what purpose it is for. This set of requirements will help us in the future to ease design choices and include features that are coherent with our philosophy. The following is a table describing the purpose of a practical general language.  

| &nbsp; | External Implements not needed |\| External Implements needed |
|--------|:--------------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| Expression | _Speak_ | _Write_ |
| Comprehension | _Listen_ | _Read_ |  

Reasoning intuitively but non-rigorously, we can see that column 3 purposes are "advanced" in the sense that ability to read and write are required but not as much as the ability to speak and listen. Besides, column 2 can be used by most people with apparatuses generally found on their bodies contrary to colum 3 which requires external implements such as ink and paper, often bought with money or resource, which may not be provisioned to every one in poor economies.
