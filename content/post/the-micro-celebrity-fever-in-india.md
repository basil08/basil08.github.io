#### what motivated this post?  

#### current state of indian celebrity 

#### responsibilities of a celebrity  

- value creation  
particular instance: indian online education scenario on yt   

- originality   




people psychology 
- herd morality 
- economic state 

exceptionally low bar to enter 

a platform to voice own opinions / and everybody wants to be heard, admired etc

#### challenges  

fizz out    
lack of content   
competition    
pseudo-celebrity effect - wants to run and hide from all the attention. human not adept to "knowing" thousands of people.  
post-spike unrest &amp; after viral desperation   

#### how will it end?  

should we be concerned?  

prediction of small groups of fandom

precautions?
