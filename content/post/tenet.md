## What Tenet means to me    

Yesternight was my second watching of Tenet, the lastest offering of Christopher Nolan. Personally, I am tired of people who make movies _assuming_ the audience to be fools. It derages me to no end by this attack on my intelligence. But Nolan movies invite the audience to think and in that process, captivate the audience with its charm, which extends well beyond the ~150 minutes of the movie and when one rise from this stupor, one feels self-accomplished and comes away with exceeding gratitude towards the man who made it possible.    

To say that I liked Tenet would be an understatement (of course). I absolutely loved it. Anytime I sit to watch a Nolan movie do I expect not to get flabbergasted. Instances where ideas of time and temporal fluidity may have been investigated, Marooned in Realtime (in literature for eg) and admit, rather naively, that I haven't explored them. Tenet being my introduction to the "genre" would be as splendid an introduction as I could have asked for.    

Tenet, for me will always be a work in progress (atleast until I am completely satiated and convinced). I'll pluck pieces of it from time to time and relish it with great delight, toying with it, stretching it, bending it and possibly looking for answers in books or reaching out to more able people than this stupid ignorant me. Physics, philosophy and cinematography all brought together in a subtle and coherent confluence.   

I admit I am not a film scholar or in any position to gauge the cinematography of the film but I'm sure the end-effect, the mixture of all things taken and considered will overpower anyone clever enough to listen what the film _really_ has to say. I shall hazard to call Tenet my favourite movie of all time which is a naive statement by its very nature.   

Tenet will be my favourite until something better is envisioned. It may seem paradoxical but I am only a passenger of time, looking at the world through a key hole constrained not in space but also in time. (If you reflect, you'll be convinced that so are you). We will evolve, of course, and in due course, outsmart our ancestors and so is it with Tenet. I believe in constant strive towards excellence. Tenet will be a fine example of its time (pun intended).  

I can envision myself watching this movie after say 10 or 20 years and it would still be as exciting as it is today. Yes, it's one of those timeless stuff that ages well with time.   

To be honest, it was difficult to wrap my head around the portrayal of the idea of inversion with reverse footage. I'll need more time with the movie to comprehend its events and question everything. In hindsight, this is what Nolan had intended to achieve. His effect is manifest in the aftermath of the movie wherein the audience must satiate her disturbed soul and convince herself that indeed nothing stands in contradiction as it should be.   

PS: Maybe the last line isn't as true as it seems but I'll take into account the fact that cinema is inherently imaginative.
