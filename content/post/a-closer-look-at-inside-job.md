"Inside Job" is a 2010 documentary written, directed and produced by Charles Ferguson on the 2008 global financial crisis. It makes for an enlightening and thrilling watch that makes us aware of the corrupt world we live in. I believe this film should be watched by every citizen who cares about where their hard earned money goes.  

This documentary is not an "easy" watch that you can grab on a lazy afternoon comfortable on your couch. It has complex sounding terms and concepts that should keep you on the edge of seat. As those financial experts makes the layman believe, "What we do is far more complicated for you to understand so you better leave us alone as we do it." They are soft-headed people who will make you feel witless and run away with your money. That is exactly what happened in 2008.   

## Economics is a fascinating subject   

Economics is a fascinating subject because it aims to study the very fondation that sustains our society: money. But according to me, it is a study of resource allocation (More on this in a future post). It is a set of the simplest ideas that basically run our lives. What people don't realise is that a small section of people deliberately obfuscate those ideas with cooked-up complex terms just to _con_ everybody else.  

Concepts at the root of the 08' crisis:  

1. **Information assymmetry**: It means when a party has more information regarding a transaction than the other party. A rampant example is the real estate industry where the agent has a more intimate knowledge of the market and the value of the property than you do and clearly, they have no incentive to act in your favor.   

2. **Incentives**: The powerhouse of any transaction in a economy. I have an incentive to educate myself because I know I can earn more money that way. People basically get up in the morning and do _any_ work (even go out and shoot somebody) because they have an incentive. Incentives drives all our actions, even non-economical. (Don't proceed further if you get offensed easily) Think about your relationships. You may love your partner. But (really) deep down, it's just an incentive to have something you don't.  

3. **Value**: The basic principle why any transaction is carried out is because you are valuable to the other party. Maybe you invented something, maybe only you can offer a service. The idea is, people should be paid proportionately for the value they create in society. Money is a measure and storehouse of that value. It is a token that says, "Yes, this person is entitled to redeem this much worth for anything else". This is crucial. 

That's it! That's all that is at the core of the crisis. So, let's dig into it.  

## How it happened? 

The following is a brief summary of what led to the housing market crash.  

1. Deregulation in the financial market of the US from the 1980s  

Following the Great Depression of 1930s, the financial market of the US was stable and secure due to government regulation. However, during and after the Cold War, few lobbyists started putting pressure on the Congress to deregulate those institutions. What it basically meant was remove restrictions on private banks and firms to use depositor's (that is, you) money and invest them more freely. It made bankers more greedy and ambitious.  

2. Explosion of derivatives  

Think of derivatives as artificial products that banks can offer you. Traditionally, banks are generally involved in lending and borrowing money. But, bankers can devise creative "instruments" &ndash; agreements really, that can allow people to bet on anything. Rising crude oil prices, the bankruptcy of a company, or even the weather. Why? Because they charged money. Those institutes began exerting power over the political system of the US and got a law passed that banned regulations on derivatives.  

3. Securitization  

30 years ago, home buyers would go to a willing lender, ask them for money and then repay them on a fixed basis. Naturally, those lenders were very carefully as to who they lent their money.  

Securitization is a concept whereby the lender has no fear of not being repaid. They simply sell their mortgages to an investment bank. Consequently, lenders started making riskier loans because they didn't care if people don't repay. Loans for over 90% of the home price was offered. 

4. Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)  

Banks would buy mortgages from lenders, package a lot of them into a CDO, and sell them to investors around the world who would be happy to have a steady flow of cash because who doesn't pay their mortgages? You see, it's just the same, boring "I have money. You don't but you need it. Okay, let me give you my money but you promise to pay me that and some more" packaged in new wrapping foil. Only this time, those mortgages were subprime. Meaning they were bad debt. Those people had over 90% of the home price paid by the mortgage and so had no incentive to keep the house. The moment they couldn't pay their bills, they can simply walk away because they had no stake in it.  

5. Rating agencies  

These are institutes, Moody's, Standard and Poor's and Fitch were the key players at that time, that independently assess a financial instruments risk, returns etc and give them ratings to assist the investor in making an investment in those products. The problem was, the banks were paying these agencies to give AAA, or triple A rating (highest rating, equivalent to a goverment bond in terms of security) to subprime CDOs. Why? Because how else will they sell those rotten apples? Further, the agency had no liability if those CDOs turned bad.     

6. Predatory lending   

Subprime loans carried higher interest rates. So, the banker had an incentive to offer you those products that maximized his profits, not caring if those borrowers would be able to pay those loans. This is predatory lending.  

This cycle reinforced one another, pumping out more loans, feeding the bankers. Employees of major banks like Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers among others were paid "bonuses". People owned not one, but five houses. Expensive penthouses, private jets. They degraded to drugs. Prostitution was rampant (and these charges were shown as business expenses), among other things. These greedy, bald people saw money, an unrestricted environment to operate, and a way to extract money for practically creating no value. They were artificially creating these instruments that they knew were bad, bribing rating agencies, and selling them off for the profits. But, there is more.   

7. Credit Default Swaps  

AIG, the premier American insurance company, offered others to bet on certain events, such as the fall of a company, or debts going bad, asking them to pay a monthly premium for a return if their bet came true. Few investment banks saw those CDOs will go bad and started betting against their success and simultaneously selling them off to investors citing they were excellent triple-A products! There is more. Moreover, others can speculate on these too. So, if something those CDOs do go bad, AIG is in big trouble. Such chain enforcements blew the crisis out of proportions.   

After a time, they saw that AIG will go bust trying to repay them after those CDOs go bad which they new were a certainty, so they began to insure themselves for being guaranteed payments from AIG in case the CDOs failed.  

## The destruction   

People say $x was wiped out from the economy. But that is absurd. How can money be just wiped out in a flash? The truth is, there was no money to start with. Only on paper. There was _no value backing that money_. It was just a facade conjured by those bankers in their heads. What was the price?   

Iceland went bust. Millions of migrant workers in China lost their jobs. Americans lost their savings, jobs, homes. Stock markets around the world plunged. Nobody was lending any money. The financial system came to a stand still. Yes, pretty horrible for misaligned incentives, ghost value, and people not knowing what the hell they were doing.      

## Who were accountable? What happened to them?  

All of them walked home smiling with severance, reimbursements and damages running in the millions. Most still serve on advisory boards, and board of directors of major companies.   

Even, academic economists were incentivised to misdirect the community into believing certain facts that weren't true and got compensated. After all, money runs the world. Not morals. 

## What is to come and what we should do 


First drill this into your mind, **Economics/Finances/Markets/Policies are not hard or you ain't dumb but people make it appear so.**  

I personally believe, overall prosperity (and survival) of everyone depends on equal access to informational and consumer rights. As we enter the 2nd quarter of the 21st century, the world economy will be even more closely knit. Corporations and firms will continue to act in their best interests. Economics and government policies have to stabilise this delicate balance of powers to ensure basic rights and progress for all.   

It is only when we, the citizens, have accurate knowledge as to what goes "up there" that we can safeguard our interests, voice our opinions, and strengthen our oppositions. The Internet has democratized knowledge. It isn't elite property regulated by the 1%. We must leverage it.
