Leadership is fueled by charisma, and an almost insane level of self-obsession - micheal


## Dwight Schrute


Against all odds, discipline triumphs - dwight

## Jim Halpert 

> ### "Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica." — Jim Halpert (pretending to be Dwight)

It's okay to goof around. It's ok to feel lost, most people don't know what they want. It's a blessing to be crystal and forthcoming of your priorities - jim

## Pam Beesly

Pam - maybe you don't have to search too far. What you're looking for may just be right in front of you.

## Angela Martin 

Angela - you don't always have to do what others say to be likeable. It's ok to have an inflated sense of self-hygiene and esteem

## Darryl Philbin


Darryl - one step at a time but surely a step each time

## Andrew Bernard 

Andy-erin relationship

Criticism

Beginning seasons were too unhinged especially Micheal - sexist, racist and a lot more. Then they probably rewrote the character and turned him more irritable (likable still but not as much). I saw Scott as a maverick which was not quite there towards his ending appearances.

Also, what's up w all these cussing lately?

Plot got twisted and mashed w office romances too much towards the end. Compare w starting seasons.


_____


What started out as a depiction of an average American small business company turned out to be a masterclass in life itself complete with fostering friendships and relationships.

I'm a little stitious

"Sometimes I'll start a sentence and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation." — Michael Scott
