**Disclaimer**: Sorry, the title is a bit misleading. The verses in this post only cover the 29th and 30th chapter of the Quran. Compiling verses from the full Quran is a task too big to take with my current commitments but something I will eventually get to, hopefully.<sup>2<sup>


{{<dropcap>}}This post {{</dropcap>}} is intended to record some of the verses from the 29th and 30th chapter of the Quran that I find very powerful and moving. I have tried to record my first reaction to reading it, which has most often been awe and reverence, so I can come back to it later (I may add to this list but no promises). A lot of my Muslim readers have read these verses multiple times but it hits really different once one understands what it means.    

Personally, I was raised in an environment where Islamic education was present but not imposed strictly which meant I didn’t find prayer, reading the Quran, and the remembrance of God as essential to my day-to-day activities but something as an afterthought. Also, in the Indian subcontinent, Muslims are taught to _read_ the Quran (since Arabic is not a native language for South Asians) but not to _understand_ it which is an absurdity for which I haven’t found any reason so far. This meant that I could pronounce the words but I could not understand them. The last six months have been a departure from this tragedy and I am grateful to God for it. For the curious and those who hunger for knowledge, I invite you to read and understand the Quran with sincerity.<sup>1</sup>

# The Rivalry In Worldly Increase

{{<blockquote>}}
102:1
أَلْهَىٰكُمُ ٱلتَّكَاثُرُ ١

 1. The mutual rivalry (for piling up of worldly things) diverts you,


102:2
حَتَّىٰ زُرْتُمُ ٱلْمَقَابِرَ ٢

 2. Until you visit the graves (i.e. till you die).

https://quran.com/102/1-2

{{</blockquote>}}

I remember the first time I read these two verses I didn’t move for a couple minutes - not only because of how eloquent it is but also how starkly relevant it was to me. The legacy of my college weighed down on me and somehow I found the walls closing in on me if I do not stand up to their expectations - what will society call me then? An IITian failure? The mutual contest to get the best for myself was the worst thing for me - I was burnt out, desperate, and lost. Over time, I realised it isn’t about _me_, it’s about _us_. 

# The Ascending Stairways

{{<blockquote>}}

70:19
۞ إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ خُلِقَ هَلُوعًا ١٩

 19. Verily, man (disbeliever) was created very impatient;



70:20
إِذَا مَسَّهُ ٱلشَّرُّ جَزُوعًۭا ٢٠

 20. Irritable (discontented) when evil touches him;



70:21
وَإِذَا مَسَّهُ ٱلْخَيْرُ مَنُوعًا ٢١

 21. And niggardly when good touches him.



70:22
إِلَّا ٱلْمُصَلِّينَ ٢٢

  Except those who are devoted to Salât (prayers).


70:23
ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَلَىٰ صَلَاتِهِمْ دَآئِمُونَ ٢٣

 23. Those who remain constant in their Salât (prayers);



70:24
وَٱلَّذِينَ فِىٓ أَمْوَٰلِهِمْ حَقٌّۭ مَّعْلُومٌۭ ٢٤

 24. And those in whose wealth there is a recognised right



70:25
لِّلسَّآئِلِ وَٱلْمَحْرُومِ ٢٥

 25. For the beggar who asks, and for the unlucky who has lost his property and wealth, (and his means of living has been straitened).

https://quran.com/al-maarij

I cannot overlook the striking resemblance of the first three verses of this section to my prior way of living. It sent me on a deep introspection of my ways of living and helped me answer the question of what to live for.

My interpretation of _“human was created impatient”_ can be seen freely today in the action of human beings - thousands have taken to short-term gratification and following vanity and falsehood that are beyond their reach (Yes, I’m talking about watching half-naked girls dancing on Instagram reels). I have suffered deeply when I was lost in that hellhole, feeling horrible about myself with each passing day, desiring things that are sensibly beyond my reach and for which I have no use. I am talking about the loss of mutual trust which has distanced man from man and the basic courtesy of honesty and truthfulness. I am talking about the need for therapy and medicines we spend to feel happier when all we need is the increasingly rare but honest smile.

I absolutely love how the phrase _“in whose wealth there is a recognised right for the less fortunate”_ embodies the notion of social welfare within the frameworks of the religious duties. It has helped me to not only know how to manage what I have but motivates me everyday to strive for more to give to those less fortunate than me.<sup>3</sup>

# The Clot 

{{<blockquote>}}
96:1
ٱقْرَأْ بِٱسْمِ رَبِّكَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ١

 Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists).



96:2
خَلَقَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ ٢

 2. He has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood).



96:3
ٱقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ ٱلْأَكْرَمُ ٣

 3. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.



96:4
ٱلَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِٱلْقَلَمِ ٤

 4. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen.



96:5
عَلَّمَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ ٥

 5. He has taught man that which he knew not.



96:6
كَلَّآ إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ لَيَطْغَىٰٓ ٦

 6. Nay! Verily, man does transgress (in disbelief and evil deed).



96:7
أَن رَّءَاهُ ٱسْتَغْنَىٰٓ ٧

 7. Because he considers himself self-sufficient.



96:8
إِنَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ ٱلرُّجْعَىٰٓ ٨

 8. Surely, unto your Lord is the return.

The importance of acquiring new knowledge can be estimated by realising _Iqra_ (meaning: To Read) was the first word revealed to the Prophet PBUH by God. I haven’t found a more telling account of my own actions than the verses 6-8. I was proud and arrogant of what I had (which was, in retrospect, nothing) and used to speak hateful words to others. I don’t think I am a perfect human being yet and I still make mistakes but at least I’m trying. It’s astounding, once you put your mind to it, to realise how easy it is to hurt someone unknowingly. 

# Parting Thoughts

Well, I only wish I could do a more extensive version of this post for I have so many beautiful verses noted in my notebook. It pains my heart to see Muslims today not even trying to understand the Quran, following vain pursuits and desires (myself included), and finding themselves truly lost. I wish they would understand. I’ll close this post with the following verse which is a powerful rhetoric found in one of most visually bone-chilling chapters of the Quran,

{{<blockquote>}}
The Overthrowing (81:26) 

فَأَيْنَ تَذْهَبُونَ ٢٦

 26. Then where are you going?

# Trivia

[Feel free to skip if you do not want the context for this post]

A little bit of life update - I have joined the Masters programme at the Department of CSE at IIT Delhi and expect to graduate next year. This means that most of my friends have already graduated and I am mostly left alone to my thoughts with lots of free time. I suffered from depression and anxiety (and still do sometimes) and last year was really bad. But then I revisited the Qur’an and tried to understand it. Studying the Qur’an has been one of the most rewarding experiences for me in the last six months. 

# Footnotes

1: Note that I haven't said anything about being a Muslim or a non-Muslim here - the only condition is curiosity and sincerity. This is because I haven't found a single Muslim (yet) who really understands what's writtein in the Quran. And as for non-Muslims, I do not believe reading the Quran is any different from reading any other book as long as you are respectful. 

2: God willing.

3: You may also read the seven verses of [Surah 107 (Small Kindnesses)][0] for a description of those who show off and rebuke the poor.
