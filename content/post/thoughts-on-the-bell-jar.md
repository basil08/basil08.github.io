Plath is somehow trying to get down on paper all her flaws she had taken so much care to hide from the world. She wants all these demons that are inside her to finally get out. Plath's husband: Ted Hughes.  
  
The protagonist: Miss Esther Greenwood.
Three chapters in: She has already told us what an awful friend she is letting her passed out friend Doreen stay in her vomit outside her room on the carpet while she slept the night away. How she had lied to Mr. Manzi, her science teacher at college and managed to fool him and the authority into evading Chemistry but more awful that Mr. Manzi thought she was a truly passionate student and attended his lectures for the love of it.  
How she enjoys lavish presents, gifts, endorsement products, free passes and so on that all these companies give them.  
How she is a complete food maniac, selfish and determined. How she plots and strategises around the table for her caviar, all her thought process confided to us in their raw form. 
Little nasty things like stepping on as many foots as she went out the row of people at the theatre or puking in the cab and the hotel elevator.  
Drinking the finger-bowl water at her benefactress'.
Always had trouble with men because of her height.

Then she starts on how people around her have been awful and nasty to her. 
Buddy Willward, the two-faced Janus.
Constantin, who didn't find her suitable to seduce.
