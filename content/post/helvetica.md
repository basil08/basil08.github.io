Few days back, I happened to rewatch Helvetica. It is a independent 2007 documentary on the enormously successful and ubiquitous typeface called Helvetica. Even unconsciously, there is a huge chance that you have read or seen this typeface. Part of its success is because of what typographers describe as neutrality. The design of Helvetica itself doesn't invoke any emotion thus, allowing the content to speak for itself. Secondly, it is an ideal font for communication exchange in the hyper-connected, hyper-fast modern world. The decades following the personal computing era were turbulent times for designers in general as they tried to master the new medium of expression. Standards were devised for everything from colours to screen sizes. Trivialities that most people won't even consider, and yet which forms the cornerstone of digital print economy today. Typography is one such neglected yet fascinating discipline. It is true that type designing as it used to be in the 1960s is obsolete and the job of a type designer is no more the same, it is however, not defunct.  

Effect of typeface on consumer psychology. 
Modernism and post-modernism.
The attack on typography in the 90s.

I caught myself yawning several times through the ~80 minutes runtime. Even during the rewatch. There are many long self-justifications by people who are somewhat uncomfortable about the fate of their craft which is natural (Perhaps I am wrong but I could sense it). Designers are grumpy and screechy. Probably a mass general characteristic.

One of the things that I bitterly regret in my life is the absence of people around me who can appreciate design and art. Yes, it is true that I'm not an expert on the subject but I'm striving to be. People around me accept the things just the way they are. Complacency or irresponsibility, I couldn't figure out. But listening to these people talk about the finest details about their craft, the tiniest design choices that distinguishes timeless from good, I have come to realise it is these people who would understand me better. European developed countries, most likely Germany or France, seems to be quite attractive candidates. The land of Bauhaus has seen many revolutionary masters and it would be a privilege to study their work and glimpse into their minds. And so is it with beloved France. Oh, oh. I know. I want to own a graphics studio. Nothing like the horrors we have today. Especially an Indian graphic design studio. This country suffers from the cancer of the ignorance of design.
