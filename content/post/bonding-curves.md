Decentralised Finance or DeFi, has taken the world by storm and the technocrats are divided on whether the tech is truly revolutionary or not. Even though, the progress in DeFi is mind-numbing, people are yet to yield the true benefits that the blockchain enables. The current state of DeFi rests with the spawning of a number of speculation and lending markets (such as [Compound][2], [AAVE][3]), complementing their traditional counterparts. For a comprehensive bird-eye view of the history of DeFi, I strongly recommend [this post][0] by [@njess][1].   

Speculation markets work by providing a platform for traders to bet on the value of any digital asset over time. DeFi is experimenting with devising financial instruments like futures and options for digital assets as evident by a number of perpetual futures protocols like Perpetual, dYdX, Mycelium, etc.

Why would anyone trade ETH for a fungible token? 
- Tokens are expected to have value that will appreciate overtime. Why would this happen? We don't know. We don't know if it will even appreciate. We hope it will. With increase in demand, the price of tokens would go up. 

Clarification: How is this different from traditional economics principle of scarcity => increase in price. More tokens in circulation means more demand. It's not like more tokens => less scarcity.  


Price discovery mechanism. 
Depends on value of the token presently
= Sum of total future cash flows available to the bearer
Is it possible to determine the future cash flow of a token in all cases? How to figure out the future cash flows for a token? 

Problem of pricing mechanism when market is small and liquidity is less.
Enter AMMs
