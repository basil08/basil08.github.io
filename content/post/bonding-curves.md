Why would anyone trade ETH for a fungible token? 
- Tokens are expected to have value that will appreciate overtime. Why would this happen? We don't know. We don't know if it will even appreciate. We hope it will. With increase in demand, the price of tokens would go up. 

Clarification: How is this different from traditional economics principle of scarcity => increase in price. More tokens in circulation means more demand. It's not like more tokens => less scarcity.  


Price discovery mechanism. 
Depends on value of the token presently
= Sum of total future cash flows available to the bearer
Is it possible to determine the future cash flow of a token in all cases? How to figure out the future cash flows for a token? 

Problem of pricing mechanism when market is small and liquidity is less.
