Have you ever noticed that some things that are meant to happen just happens? And things that you plan but ain't meant to happen either fail or end up being sour enough to make you wonder why you started in the first place.    


My first digital hackathon falls in the first category. Even now, when I reminisce the weekend before, I cannot help but wonder how could this ever have been possible.

## It all starts with music (Seriously, no kidding)

I had my earphones plugged on a lazy Thursday afternoon. It was either ABBA or Cocteau Twins and I came across this podcast on Spotify called "How to Start a Startup" by  Sam Altman of Y Combinator fame. I ended up reading the transcripts for the first intro lecture. And their, nestled in one annotation was a link to [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io). A website which curates ongoing hackathons around the globe.   

Due to the grace of the pandemic this year, all events are digital and hence, open to anyone. I ended up signing for one!

## The fine print

`hack@home` was the first digital hackathon conducted by the CS club of [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu). It was a four day long weekend including loads of talks, ctfs, model training (ML), fun events, games, workshops, software engineering and of course, hacking!

I ended up with 3 other people from around the world collaborating on a project decided upon on a discord chat group on a weekend. As crazy as it may sound, I was pretty excited as an additional fun fact was Brown University is in Eastern Time Zone, exactly -0930 from IST. With complete inversion of timezones on my first hackathon, I knew I was in for some fun :).

## Meet my teammates (from around the world)

Everyone didn't really dispelled their identities but I could place some reasonable guesses.   
 
`thatrobotdev` (James) was a high school freshman. He had quite a few interesting ideas (and we eventually went ahead with one of his). He was in MST which puts him 2 hours ahead of EST and somewhere in North America. 

`sameem` Sameem was a CS freshman from Pakistan. She was the closest mate I had in terms of proximity.  

`alt er love` was a freshman who contributed substantially to negotiations and building. This person was the most ambiguous of all (I don't even know their gender).They were from the US eastern coast, that's all I know.

## My experience

I missed the opening ceremony as there was _absolutely no way_ I was gonna wake up at 2:30 am and listen to people giving boring keynotes sitting in their homes at 5 in the evening.

I did attend an ice breaker just for the sake of knowing what they are like. Ice breakers are generally mini-events or games which are aimed at breaking the initial discomfort of being in the company of strangers and facilitating opening up. It wasn't pretty interesting especially at 5am.

I attended one basic CTF workshop (again just for the sake of experiencing one) and it was pretty OK. There were many prizes to be won for different things, all shipped to your home(!)

Apart from that, I primarily programmed on [repl](https://repl.it). We planned to build a frontend app which aided in speech memorization but our plan couldn't mature to fruition. Anyway, I had a blast working on the collaborative repl, with watching other people writing code alongside me. It was pretty fun on their discord server too :) .

## Regrets

Ah, I so wished this were an in-person hackathon so I could have meet those awesome people. And had way more fun than what I did. Also, apologies for being at a deficiency of good album photographs :(.

Maybe, I'll also mention not studying for school and JEE under regret, though it's more of guilt honestly. 

## What I learn.   

* **Take the initiative**. If you request, your request is more likely to be accepted than when you didn't try at all.

* **Approach your better always**. Even if you don't learn, you'll end up learning so much more than what you started with. And in the worst possible scenario, you'll just be turned down.

* **Keep things simple**. Get a working something running. And then improve bits of it one at a time.(KISS, anyone? :))

* **Remember to have fun!** Cause life is too short to be lost in contemplation!

## Closing thoughts

I would be better off slowing down along this path and investing more time in learning and building more personal projects. Then when I am more equipped, I would surely be looking forward to my first in-person hackathon!
