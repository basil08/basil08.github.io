Inspired by Patrick Collison's luscious [bookshelf][bookshelf], this page is the list of books I have read in the current year (whichever year you are reading it). Most of these are plucked from other people's recommendation lists, popular choices, stuff I find interesting or just a random topic I want to learn about on a Saturday evening. Suggestions? Drop me a [line][mailto]!

I read somewhere (probably in an Umberto Eco article) that one can understand a man by going through his bookshelf. In any case, this is my bookshelf and I leave you to judge me at my worth. Happy browsing!

1. {{<ds sum="Dune | Frank Herbert">}}

Probably my favourite science-fiction saga so far. I'll write more about it when I finish the other books.

2. Dune Messiah | Frank Herbert
3. Mossad | Michael Bar-Zohar and Nissim Mishal
4. {{<ds sum="India Unbound | Gurcharan Das">}}

Undoubtedly, this is a book which has fired a lot of imagination and thought in me. _India Unbound_ is a socio-political and economic analysis of India from Independence to the 2000s, written in a semi-memoir-like style by a liberal. This is exactly what I was looking for in terms of depth of analysis which is well suited to a beginner layman. I can now say I have decent historical context to analyse future reports and events in India. I can philosophise a lot after reading this book but I'll stop myself and wait till I have seen _my India_. A quarter of a century is a generation and a long time for India to come-of-age. In some distant future, I wish to see India as it exists today and record what this miraculous nation is upto since the 2000s. And yet, somewhere deep down I'm afraid that I romanticise much.

Maybe it is not as rosy as it seems. For as I keep pondering Gurcharan's words, I realised how bound we are to our uncontrollable fates being somehow thrown into the world and asked to make sense of it (and honestly, not a lot of us have the mental awareness to seek out the "moral and spiritual platform" to view themselves and the world around them and are happy to learn, earn, and die). I mean the individual aspirations of one person may not be enough to steer a country to greatness (because these are macroscopic emergent properties) or it might not be achievable in their lifetime. Is it then still worth it? To follow a passion so dearly as to gamble everything else? 

I was born a decade after the economic reforms into a India which spoke of television and Coca-Colas and grew up in relative connectedness to the world through the Internet, listening to Radiohead and U2. And yet, _my India_ is not the complete picture. It is like looking at the picture through a narrow slit. I yearn to see the picture. Maybe some day I will. 

There are 2 sequels to this book on the broader themes of _Dharma_ (Morality) and _Kama_ (Desire) while this one dealt with _Artha_ (Wealth). I'll probably skip those for now and come back to them later.

5. {{<ds sum="Understanding Power | Noam Chomsky">}}

Probably not a major upgrade after reading 'How the World Works' because it has the same themes and topics that it talks about. It follows the same format - just a set of Chomsky's talks and Q&As edited together into a book. The organisation is also not something I particularly like - its arranged choronologically and maintains too much of the conversational flow to be worthwhile to mentally address the sections. I didn't see any particularly good organisation metric used (For instance, HTWW had a country-wise organisation in the last section). The fact that the chapter and section titles are abstract-y doesn't help either. But those are not Chomsky's fault, those are the editor's faults. 

The material reads like Chomsky and gets repetitive (especially if you have already read HTWW). At times, I got rather bored of the same "US is oppressing poor countries" narrative and felt sleepy. It's true, however, that Chomsky is perhaps one of the very few people who are actually first-order thinkers on geopolitics and human rights. The passion that exudes from the text is very typical of far-left thinkers. Chomsky is able to back his claims with irrefutable data and insights that I suspect very few are even capable of mentally arrriving at. 

As an experiment, I tried to "read" this book by listening as an audiobook. Some worthwhile use of commute time to my office during internship. Would I do it again? Yes, perhaps. It's better than just letting the mind wonder but I'm not sure how retentive it really is. But then, is there any reason to believe that read material is more retentive?

6. {{<ds sum="Men of Mathematics | E. T. Bell">}}

Slightly racist, slightly provocative, and maybe not exactly the kind of humour a lot of people in the 21st century will approve of and easily take offense with but still, this book remains a definitive account of around 30 of the best mathematicians that mankind has to offer. It's written in a challenging prose but that only goes on to establish the command and authority of the author over words. He takes care to vet the mathematically inclined reader with a few doses of formulae and symbols - overall, his explanations remain accessible with a bit of insight and serious thought. 

Besides, the author tries to glorify the mathematicians somewhat and takes the high-ground snobbery approach of considering other humans as lowly even. It's hilarious at time, the kind of insults and low-blow attacks that the author writes about (Sadly, I cannot reproduce them anymore because an earlier draft of this review which _did_ contain those chosen extracts was lost due to an OS system crash, apologies!) 

I have fond memories of picking this book up at a local library and being intimidated by the lofty language and the hard sentece construction and yet being intrigued by the feats of these extraordinary men that the pages talk about. It was fascinating and I'm sure some part of that went into conditioning me into beginning to love the "sciences" and books, in general, more than enjoy the company of people because unlike books, people get messy. 

I'm happy I was able to read (re-read?) this book. It has spawned my somewhat dormant pursuits of the natural sciences, espeically application of pure mathematics to physics. All that remains now, is to master the books on analysis, mathematical physics, projective geometry, and European history that I have downloaded as an impulsive side-quest. Ah, the hunger to know everything, it's maddening but oh so destructively seductive.

7. {{<ds sum="The Polyester Prince | Hamish McDonald | 1998">}}

A book that was allegedly banned in India due to muscle power of the Reliance Corp must have some substance for the conglomerate to take such a defensive and desperate step. And for good measure. This is one hell of a book. It is jammed packed with dense finance lingo thrown casually at the reader as if the author assumes that the reader are accounting and finance graduates by default and yet under the shroud of impregnable financial lingo lies the thrilling and grey world of the Ambanis and their mastery and subsequent tales of exploitation of the Indian bureaucracy and markets. For any budding enterpreneur, Dhirubhai Ambani's story from "rags to riches" is both an inspiration and a glaring warning for the challenges and routes to be taken - some of which are questionable and definitely not for the faint-hearted. 

Recommended by a friend, I enjoyed every single chapter of this book. I finished it in 3 sittings, completing half of the book in the first sitting itself. I think this should be required reading in finance and biz schools. And I suspect every enterpreneur worth their name has probably read it. Deffo recommend.
