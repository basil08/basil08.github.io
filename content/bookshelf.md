Inspired by Patrick Collison's luscious [bookshelf][bookshelf], this page is the list of books I have read in the current year (whichever year you are reading it). Most of these are plucked from other people's recommendation lists, popular choices, stuff I find interesting or just a random topic I want to learn about on a Saturday evening. Suggestions? Drop me a [line][mailto]!

I read somewhere (probably in an Umberto Eco article) that one can understand a man by going through his bookshelf. In any case, this is my bookshelf and I leave you to judge me at my worth. Happy browsing!

Anything read more than 5% but less than 100% is noted here. I have to keep a running tab of how reckless I am with my books. _sigh_.
