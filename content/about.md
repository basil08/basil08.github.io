## What should you expect from this blog?  

This is a blog about psychology, philosophy, economics, technology, science, art and design. It is not proper to believe this blog is limited to the handful of subjects listed above because it is not. To understand our lives demands a multidisciplinary stance.   

In brief, it is about every subject encompassing human existence.  

Perhaps, a better explanation is given by ACX which I quote:  

> á¹šta is a Sanskrit word, so ancient that it brushes up against the origin of Indo-European languages. It's related to English "rationality" and "arithmetic", but also "art" and "harmony". And "right", both in the senses of "natural rights" and "the right answer". And "order". And "arete" and "aristos" and all those other Greek words about morality. And "artificial", as in eg artificial intelligence. More speculatively "reign" and related words about rulership, and "rich" and related words about money.
