### Why?   
Posts serve as well-researched, well-articulated opinions and thoughts. But I wanted something that could capture tiny little fleeting ideas. I needed microblogging. Oh, you'd say, "What about Twitter, pal?" Nah, not really. So, I hacked a little microblogging server. The code is open and on [GitHub][0]. The script is hosted on the incredible [Deta][1] platform and the database on Mongo Atlas.
