Thisi s a brief account of my experiences of producing a stage play for the Inter-hostel Drama competition. Each year, the Drama Club of IITD hosts a number of competitions (called 'comps') such as stage play, street play, monoact, short film, etc. At the end of each season, they present the Drama trophy to the highest scoring hostel out of the 13 UG hostels. My hostel, Udaigiri, has an upcoming drama culture as we won the last season's drama trophy. In fact, we have a lot of outstanding (called 'machau' in IITD parlance) seniors who have considerable experience in dramatics.   

I intend to keep this a running document and keep updating it with recent developments to maintain a crisp, and fresh feel.   

## The Orientation   

The hostel cultural secretary ('cultu') called a meet of the drama core team to brief about the comp. That happened on 12th August. Few people were engaged in drama for 15th August so it wasn't an extensive meeting. Just the cultu (he/she is a junior elected for each hostel), drama rep (he/she is a sophomore associated with each BRCA club at the hostel level), and a couple other 3rd yearites to inform us that the comp is on 11th September and everyone should start looking for scripts. I helped with the script in Bandela, our entry for the last short-film comp we won, so there was considerable heads turning towards me. I accepted the challenge.   

The general periods of inactivity. People slipping away. No stakeholders stance in the club.

Me aiming to write an originial screenplay. Expanded on an idea with a friend. Late night discussions. Plot designing. using celtx. 

Drama rep pushed for his play. A tussle was evident. No one talked about it but the tension was evident in subsequent 2-3 meetings as I refused to listen to him and he refused to listen to me. We just kept talking and talking and reiterating our ideas but never coming with a convincing argument why we should go with any one of them. The volume in Udai VR just kept rising as we saw time pass by. No conclusion.  

3rd yearites withdrew without any solid reason. We were expecting no guidance, assistance in acting or direction. They visibly sneaked past VR not to get caught. The 4th years pitched in. The political dynamic in 4th year. A fundamental difference in ideology of two key players - A and M. Both trying to brain-wash 2nd yearites. Trying to put more yay-sayers to their sides. One wanted to reiterate his idea of Bandela, basically repackage it for stage. A decision that 2nd yearites unanimously disagreed with. Time was running out. Seniors used to come at different times, feed their side of the story and / or their perception and go away. Half the times, not every member of drama core was present. It was a shitshow. There was no progress. It seemed like everything was in stasis.  

The drama rep calls me one night to tell me the seniors. Withdrawal of my confidence in the abilities of the drama rep. 

The collab fiasco. 

Harit sir, a ray of hope. A new search. Me watching stage plays on YT. A new dimension opened. Realised that original will be shit. Convincing people not to do something I had pushed for so long would be to provide them with a better alternative. "A play with words" and "Hallmarks of Horror", "The Moustrap", "Panchi aise aate hain", "A proposal" - a great deal of personal learning happened. (Watching theater live is still on my bucket list though). 

Subsequently reaching a decision. The A brainwash episode. A compromise. 

No work for two days now. Today is 28th August, the comp is on 18th September. I have to improvise on the script.
