We all make mistakes. I made one too. And, now I'm wiser.   

I was uncannily hasty in accepting the roommate I was asked to pair up with and I didn't have second thoughts about the decision I was making. I literally said yes to the first guy to come along. It turns out we are totally different in all aspects of our viewpoints. I have learnt so much that I want to recount and remind myself, both from the mistake I have made and the consequent path it has led me onto.   

I have learnt to cooperate and listen to the other person's needs and demands. Most importantly, I have learnt to help and be more generous. Honestly, I have surprised myself in the generosity I have found myself exhibiting in the past few days. I have learnt to collaborate and communicate. He is not from a city, actually a village near Jodhpur and so is oblivious to most "city" habits and lifestyle. For example: His vehemant refusal to attend the dance workshops and other club meets just because they will affect his "studies". It was funny, in a way. And you know me, how strong a proponent of overall development of the mind I am. Then, I sat down and explained to him. I have done things I never thought I would have done. 

We are really diamterically opposite. For example: He sleeps with the lights on, I prefer them switched off. He takes his food at absurdly early hours relative to mine. I, for sometime, suspected he feared the food in the mess would run out (!) He says _"haasil"_ instead of "borrow" while performing addition. I couldn't help but notice these irrelevant differences between us. I should have really put some thought before selecting my roommate. It is, by all means, an important decision in college. 

We ain't all differences. We both belong to financially weak families so we have atleast one ground of similarity. A common cause to which we both can identify and participate in each other's joy and misery. He has a younger sister too, just like mine!     

I now understand better the dynamics of choosing partners and can grasp with better clarity how it would be like to be in a relationship where people _not only_ share rooms but also share their lives together. Clearly, I'm still lacking viable data (experience if you will) in this particular niche but we're getting there and I'm happy.
