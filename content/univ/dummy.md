First week snapshot

I have been meaning to write about my first week or so for a long time now so here goes.   

I arrived in campus on the fateful 22nd day of Dec 2021. I was mandated three days of quarantine as per institute norms so those three days were pretty straightforward and dare I say "peaceful". 

I started this post in the morning and I just can't think of a linear fashion of telling my story. There has been an explosion of events and activities that have subtle and far-reaching effects than I can possibly express in this post. It feels like I have been ripped off from my comfortable equilibrium and thrown into a mix whose dynamics are alien to me. For instance, I cannot read as much as I used to or as much as I (really really) want to. I cannot code which is really fucking crazy. But to be honest, there wasn't much to do at home apart from reading or coding. Here, it's a totally different ballgame.

## General social interaction   

My roommate is confused how could I, being such a sincere student (he heard about my NTSE and KVPY) have such a poor performance in JEE. How do I tell him about my incessant thirst for knowledge and my fanatical love for computer science? Who, really who can truly understand my pure love for computer science?    

People I meet keep telling me I'm cool but they don't tell me why. I don't know why. :man_shrugging: :smile:
