I'm writing this in the evening so the day isn't quite over yet. But, it was a very unproductive day, academics wise. I overslept and woke up at 8:00 (I know it's disgusting). Somehow dragged myself down for breakfast at the mess. Came back around 09:00 and sat down to do something. Now, because I had dozed off last night _without_ making an approximate TODO plan for today, I was lethargic the whole time. Around 09:30, I realised I had a class from 09:00. That's right. Lazy.  

Anyway, it was a APL100 Tutorial. I don't remember exactly when but I dozed off _again_ in the middle of the class and woke up with a start around 10:30 with earphones still plugged in my ears. So much for the morning. Then, I watched a APL100 lecture on YT as there's an approaching APL100 quiz next week and minors from first week of Jan.   

It so happened that I had three-four accumulated chores to run and I got tangled in them bad, like really bad. It was mainly a logistical error. However, I somehow managed to meet a senior from dev club and we had a really long talk past the mess timings on a lot of tech things (Getting his number was a chore though).  

We talked about general development projects that DevClub takes up and how it caters to the IITD environment. I was (and still am) eager to know if there are fundamental research in CS going on in the campus. For eg: the kind of research that took place at MIT and Princeton in the 1960s. I want to know if we are questioning the boundaries of the field itself. I want to know if we are building _truly revolutionary technologies_. Anyway, so then we talked about the hype among the freshers of my batch with respect to "startups". Startup. God, this word has become the cherry kid for media houses these days. Look wherever you go and some guy/girl is becoming a billionaire overnight. Now, obviously I know the fallacy in this logic. It's stupid to base our judgments and / or opinions on the outcome. But, the "facchas" (as the freshers are called in IITD lingo) are so hyped about "starting up", it makes me laugh. Seriously.   

And, then he talked about "quant", or quantitative trading firms. My mind was literally blown. 14 lakhs per month for an internship. What the fuck is going on?! I was literally numb. He talked about CS guys who got 1cr+ packages from trading firms like Jane Street and Graviton and are sitting in Gurgaon literally swimming in cash. As I'm recounting the incident, my brain is still unable to process the information. I mean, seriously dude, WHAT THE FUCK?!   

I was looking at the glass palace from the outside all this while and now I'm inside it.   

A message was floating in our hostel group about a dance workshop by our Dance Club and it was quite an interesting session, although I hadn't accounted for the ~3 hours (!) it took. Basically, acads went out the window today. But I really think I found a new passion and I'm happy.
