Past couple of days have been primarily engaged in two things: shopping and meeting people, both of which are so so unusual for me. The realisation of possessing stuff and the act of buying itself are alien to me. Similarly, the act of meeting people and maintaining myself in front of them and so on.

## So much. . .stuff

My legs have turned noodles from the amount of buying and walking through markets that I'm have done since yesterday or so. And just bought stuff. For myself. Trolleys and clothes and shoes and so on. I don't understand but I feel _unsettled_ somehow. Feels awkward to own all this expensive stuff. Even wrong in some plane of thought. Which is extremely weird and concerning because buying stuff is exactly what the majority does and believes to be the ultimate usage of their money. That's why people want to earn money. Maybe, I'm just different in that regard. I won't argue if I'm more "correct" but I'm certainly not much of a materialistic person. I don't like unnecessary stuff. And although all that I have bought are necessary, I guess I'll get used to calling them my own.

## People around      

Coming to the more interesting part, I met some of my relatives and teachers &mdash; those who I'm close with. My primary objective was to gather as many viewpoints and perspectives as possible, then analyse, and cherry pick the most over arching, fundamental ideas as the basis of a "philosophy of life" in college.

Let me summarise my family doctor's advice who has been extremely supportive of me and whom I respect immensely.

Friends
- be very discreet about disclosing personal info
- two can conspire. Never three.
- give time wrt their importance
- choose time wisely b/w friends and others
- not too social, not too reserved
- don't make no friends
- learn to gauge people


Parents
- there is nobody else in this world as honest in their love for you as these folks
- respect them


Life
- choose a _good_ spouse. Bad choice can screw your life.
- pass it on. That's how the world works.
- less material != less happiness

Lastly, **no panic in times of crises** and **no nervousness**.

Yesterday, I had visited my middle school geography teacher who adores me a lot and who supported me immensely during my 
school days.   

## Awkward Sex Education

Everyone I met was struggling to give me advice on the physical aspect of relationships and relationships in general and it was adorable watching them fail miserably because they haven't ever talked about it and it feels "wrong" to their conscience to talk to me about them all of a sudden. I even pointed out to my mother that only if relationships and sex and STDs were normalised in the household before, there might have been a conduit now and it wouldn't have been so awkward. Well, what can I do? Elders.    

Looking forward to a couple of clean up meetings with a few relatives and that would be it, I suppose.
