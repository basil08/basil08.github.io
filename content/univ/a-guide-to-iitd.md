Gyaan on SURA

1. Talk to seniors before choosing a prof. Some profs have no idea about SURA and will give you work that is impossible to complete in SURA timeline (3-4 months). So, choose profs with prior experience in SURA.
2. If your proposal has a commercial aspect, then it has higher chances of getting accepted.
3. If you value more interaction with the prof, then look for "young" profs as they generally don't have much responsibility. But senior profs generally give LORs that (naturally) hold more credibility.
