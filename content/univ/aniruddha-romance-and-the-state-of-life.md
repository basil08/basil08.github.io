## Notes on my experience at IITD

Haven't logged in a long time. Not because cool / interesting / notable stuff isn't happening to me, well, they sorta are happening but at the same time, they kinda aren't. I came to IIT Delhi believing this would be the place to witness cutting-edge research and development of novel technologies. People here would be engaged in stimulating conversation, pushing themselves to bring out the best in themselves and employ their talent and skills to bring order and comfort in the world. Except that isn't the case at all. As hartbreaking as it sounds, I hate the "IIT-as-a-ticket-to-bag-a-one-crore-package" mindset that is so prevalent here. People shy away from real learning that involves sacrifice or even a little effort and yet, they want to get hold as many resources as possible with as minimal effort. So, essentially, IIT (this IIT atleast) is mostly reduced to a "worker-making-factory" rather than a "idea-incubation-cell", the stuff that let's say happens at MIT or Stanford. IIT, the temple of knowledge is reduced to factories to train bright Indians to be imported as executives in foriegn MNCs. It pisses me off to no end.

## Introduction    

That off my chest. I can begin this post. [Aniruddha][0] and I generally have great conversations about almost anything but with him, I particular enjoy "meta-conversations". Conversations about the bigger picture, way of life, that kind of stuff. I think people generally gawk when you start talking about meta stuff and it is rare to find people who can actually hold such conversations because people generally refrain from thinking so exclusively about such things. But I believe, even unconsciously, _everyone_ has a philosophy of life. A set of commandments / directives that prioritizes stuff and guides them in decision-making. As a crude example, how does an IITian decide what they would do at the end of four years at a B. Tech degree? Should they take up a job or pursue higher studies. Notwithstanding, the myriad of other structures and circumstances specific to that person's life, taking that decision involves a certain connection to their inner self &mdash; a "conversation with oneself", if you will.

The conversation turned to romance and relationships, a topic that I still haven;t completely thought through. Exchange of ideas is another way to battletest them because in that, you essentially get a critic who uncovers the defects and weak points of your structure of ideas. But at the end of the conversation, I think we both agrees on my thoughts on romance.

1. It constitutes a small part of one's life.
2. Its purpose is to augment a person's personal growth.
3. Take every action / outcome as a learning experience.
4. Learn to love inanimate objects. They never disappoint.
5. To let nothing disturb the calm of your heart.

To summarise concisely, "Pyaar-Mohabbat moh maaya hai". But then, I conceded to him and to you too, my dear reader, of a nagging little voice in my head and a gentle heart that would appreciate the existence of a close friend, someone who can listen and respect my thoughts. Someone whose mere sight can light up a gloomy day. Someone I can bring flowers for. Someone for whom I have to put some thought to, you know, make them feel special.

Of course, life wouldn't be interesting if it were this straightforward. He talked about an interesting idea that I dubbed the "extrospection" &mdash; the ability to put some effort into understanding the other person's life and identifying _their_ aspirations, goals, and apprehensions. He talked about how people mostly live the boilerplate, superficial, socially optimal life for like 90% of the time, wherein their actions or behaviour can provide no real inference about their _true_ nature and it is only in, like, 10% of your stay with them together that they reveal their true selves.

## Romance in personal life

There has been a constant flux of activity in the romance section of my life without my active intervention. Not grand, majestic things but nothing bland either. It's fine. I have no complains partly because I don't care at this point. I want to develop myself as a person, grow myself as a novel human being, hone my skills, increase my knowledge base, physically as a man, and above everything, kind, generous, and empathic. With such an ambitious TODO list, I don't think I'll be able to actively _initiate_ a relationship. (I can manage one if it happens because that would be part of the challenge of navigating life.) Tennyson said,

I would rather wait for that one woman who would love me at that point when I'm happy with myself. Relationships at this point would be hasty and somewhere involve that element of desperation or peer pressure or both. But such relationships are not long-term, thereby harming the parties involved. Simply put, we are not emotionally equipped to handle something as complex as a relationship at this point.

There are such relationships which must be a very great, almost unbearable happiness, but they can occur only between very rich natures and between those who, each for himself, are **richly ordered and composed**, they can unite only two, wide, deep, individual worlds.
