I am sufficiently matured to realise that Spencer's overrated statement "Survival of the fittest" affects every aspect, every juncture of our lives as individual humans. I was prepared to face fierce competition here at IIT Delhi and I wasn't disappointed. But what bugs me is that this competition may or may not be fair and honest which is the whole point of me writing this post and bringing it to notice.   

As you're aware, the minor exam season is underway for 2021 UG freshmen. Today, I had my chemistry paper (CML101). Yesterday, I had calculus (MTL100). Exams are online because of surge in Covid cases on campus and New Delhi in general due to the various variants of the coronavirus. Now, it makes it so easy for people to cheat in the online environment, regardless of the precautions taken by the invigilators which, we should not kid ourselves any further, is inadequate at best and laughable at worst. Unfair means _are_ used. People who want to do it, do it. That's a fact.   

How do I know? Because I'm on the side of the students. I can see what the examiners can't. I was slightly surprised when I was offered an option to cheat in my APL100 (classical mechanics) quiz openly. I refused outright, of course. But, it set my mind into thinking and pondering a lot of the underlying assumptions about exams and evaluations and the meaning of assessments itself that we take for granted. What does it mean to assign a grade to a bunch of students if a percentage of them are chronic cheaters? Does that grade make any sense? Moreover, think about the Nash equilibrium for this system, that is, the point where all parties in the game are playing fair (I note that this is not rigorous and I'm in no mood or have the luxury of time to formulate one). Under the influence of few miscreants, the honest students will begin to cheat and suddenly the equilibrium will shift from a fair and honest exam to an unfair exam. And this, of course, has nothing to do with the ideals of exam itself. It's solely a property of the group of students as a whole. Only _their_ behaviour define the equilibrium, that is the point when nobody is at a disadvantage to anybody else. As a side note: This can become an interesting case study for anybody into behavioral analysis, game theory, and/or simulations. What conclusions can we draw from such a system? Can we come up with some idea to measure the "dishonesty coefficient" of a group and figure a way to nullify it?         

Anyway, who will suffer? Me. I mean that tiny group of unfortunate students who refuse to be dishonest. This situation is, of course, just a simple example of what Dawkins called ESS or evolutionarily stable strategy in _"The Selfish Gene"_. Because that is what _everything_ really is. From queues at supermarkets to sexual politics in a community, it's all the same. If an individual doesn't adopt the ESS, they go extinct.    

Why am I writing this post? Because to be honest, I'm kinda pissed off. All that those professors can see is the answers we write which they believe (_falsely_) is correlated to the knowledge that we have about that subject. But that isn't true. It _is_ hard being honest. Especially when you're being assessed relative to a cohort of dishonest entities. I don't want to go into the discussion of what exams really mean and what they are for but I think that is something people should have taught us before they started teaching us everything else. 

Alright, my vent is over.

In other news, I learnt that group study is bullshit iff the parties involved haven't studied anything beforehand. Because in that case, everyone thinks they can learn from others but noone really knows anything. However, it is an exponentially better way to review concepts after learning them beforehand.   

I swept my room for the first time. I washed some clothes by hand just to have the experience. Management has shut down SAC (the student activity centre) and the common rooms, gyms, etc. so missing out on those ;-; but I was up till 1 yesternight, discussing about spinels and CFT and Delhi accent and E.T. Bell. Can't wait to leverage this freedom. I also started watching [Frances Ha][0] yesternight which is a very me thing to do right before an exam but eh.
