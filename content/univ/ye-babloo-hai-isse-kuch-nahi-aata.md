_"ye babloo hai, isse kuch nahi aata"_ ("He's a babloo, he knows nothing"). Why such a quirky title to this post? Well, this is where things get interesting at IITD because that's how fellow seniors introduced themselves post 10pm in the hostel mess to freshers. This post is a personal account of my first ragging experience at IITD.   

My phone buzzed with a message from a friend asking me to go to the mess. It was past 10 in the night. To be honest, I had _no idea_ what it was going to be. The idea of ragging barely crossed my mind. Then, I entered the mess and saw lines of freshers sitting with expectant eyes and eagerly waiting for something. I reckon most had no idea what it was going to be. I, too, eager and curious took one of those uncomfortable steel seats. That friend told me it was some "informal hostel orientation".   

The seniors came in and introduced themselves. Hostel club reps (music, dance, design, FACC, and so on), BSW reps (who are called "babloos" in IITD lingo and who generally work for "student welfare"), and other guys who were there just for enjoying (or pleasure?). I was _still_ oblivious that this was ragging. Suddenly, we were asked to go to one corner of the hall and start introducing ourselves, name, place, department, hobbies, and stuff. Then, the reality of the situation hit me like a bolt from the sky and a tinge of fear gripped my heart. It stemmed from the fact that I was vulnerable to these people and had no option to refuse. It turned out to be mostly informal and a pleasant environment was maintained. They were particularly easy on me because I went second so they weren't so "inspired" yet. Subsequent freshers were asked to do simple funny things as in a guy who wants to be CM was asked to give a speech, a Gujarati eager to make a girlfriend was asked to propose a senior in Gujarati, pushups, dance, and stuff. One guy totally stole the show when he was asked what he'd want in the first six months: grades or girlfriend and he answered neither. He wanted sex. Now, I think that's a great answer from an optimization viewpoint because hey, who wants to waste time in relationship? And the guy was pretty sure grades for him were out of the league. He was practical and pretty vocal. It cracked everyone up. I found myself laughing really hard many times too.   

Losses? Yeah, I slept at past 12:30 which means I woke up around 08:00 and now my day's gonna be a bit distorted if I don't pull myself together. It was a solid two hours essentially wasted along with the domino effect of unproductivity that I'm still trying to fend off.   

As I'm writing this, I cannot help but remember the American cult classic Richard Linklater's _Dazed and Confused_. Hands down, it's one of the best portrayal of American high school cultures by one of my favourite directors (The _"Before"_ trilogy anyone?) who is capable of creating emotions so organically. It's one of my favourite movies too. If you haven't watched it, I highy recommend it. Those who have, yesternight reminding me of the _hazing_ scenes which were pretty brutal. I don't know if our situation will worsen or not.
