The Beats are difficult to define but loosely refer to the bad body of hobos, bums, and con men who were a product of the Depression of the 30s. Young, promising, and full of dreams but without a penny in pocket. As Jack so eloquently puts it, “All he needed was one wheel on his hand and four wheels on the road”. And that is a lovely definition of what this book is all about. It is rich and rich with experiences and stories that will never make a conversation go boring at dinner time and so full of sadness and melancholy at the same time. Told from the perspective of Jack’s alter ego, Sal Paradise, a wannabe writer from New York who befriends a rapturous Beat of the generation, Dean Moriarty, modelled after his friend, Neal Cassidy, the book is a wild account of what it means to be Beat and lost and still somehow find a way. They escape on daring adventures and hitchhike around the American wilderness from coast to coast, meeting old friends, making new ones, conning people, and making sure to make the most of their limited lives that are going by. Kerouac holds back nothing and there’s everything from whores and sex to drugs, and parties, and arrests and the law and brilliant descriptions of America that would make any lacklustre soul quiver with curiosity.</p><p>On a personal note, I accompanied the book with a map of the US and found myself staring at it and wondering about all those little nameless towns that were not marked on it and the little stories people would tell there and the adventures people would have on the road. As Sal said, the “road is life” and as Dean proclaimed, “we must make time”!</p><p>PS: I wonder if there is an Indian equivalent for the same but I highly doubt it and perhaps, there is a need for one and perhaps, it is time for the Indian youth to wake up to that inner call of the wilderness after all.</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none><strong>The Kite Runner | Khaled Hosseini</strong></summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>&ldquo;The Kite Runner&rdquo; is Khaled Hosseini&rsquo;s debut novel which deals with the plights and concerns of Afghanistan. Hosseini, himself taken citizenship in the US and working as a doctor, may perhaps have been the first to draw the international attention of nation states to the condition, massacre, and oppression in Afghanistan via his riveting and heart-wrenching fictions that, undoubtedly, draw from real as well as personal experiences.</p><p>To read &ldquo;The Kite Runner&rdquo; after &ldquo;A Thousand Splendid Suns&rdquo; felt like flipping the pages of a diary <em>backwards</em>. When one starts writing, they are less nuanced and more reckless. In ATSS, Hosseini presents an extremely layered story with vivid details. I felt that layered nuance lacking in TKR which is forgivable given it is his debut and I read them in the wrong order.</p><p>But do not be misled into assuming that the book doesn&rsquo;t pack a punch. Hosseini may have been frivolous with language and structure at places but occassionally, just occassionally, he would write a sentence that would suck the life out of me, make me close the book, take a deep forceful breath to rebalance myself, and ponder. He doesn&rsquo;t fail to jerk tear off of you merely by his command of word and his gift as an exceptional storyteller.</p><p>It sure took me a while to read TKR. The last of his book remains to be read.</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none><strong>Pygmalion | George Bernard Shaw</strong></summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>There are two central questions at the heart of <em>&ldquo;Pygmalion&rdquo;</em> - the more obvious, is the question of identity and how easy or difficult it is to render a different identity to a person and the second, more subtle question is of the very plausibility of the metrics used for class distinction - speech and phonetics, in this case. In fact, phonetics would undoubtedly have been a close affair with the author himself, a Dublin-based clerk with his Irish accent wishing to make his career as a writer in England. Pygmalion is classed as a romance comedy among many other things. It is a scatching satire on class distinctions in nineteenth century England. And it is a tantalizing reworking of the ancient Ovidian myth in a modern Shaw-esque feminist light.</p><p>In GBS&rsquo;s masterful command of language, his commentary and reproaches are not glaringly on the face but gather subtle. Take for instance, when Liza in Act 5 expresses her anguish at being reduced to just another bourgeois lady.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We were above that at the corner of Tottenham Court Road&mldr;I sold flowers. I didnt sell myself. Now youve made a lady of me I&rsquo;m not fit to sell anything else.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Brilliant is GBS&rsquo;s manner of criticising the condition and status of woman in the English society. He doesn&rsquo;t refrain from unleashing the impudence of the official policebody when Liza, young and foolish and tender as she was, shows considerable maturity and knowledge as to the behaviour of the policeman while she is in a loving embrace with Freddy on the road:</p><blockquote><p>FREDDY: &ldquo;I had no idea the police were so devilishly prudish.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>LIZA: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their business to hunt girls off the streets.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>It is unmistakable to miss the tribute of the play&rsquo;s title to the Greek mythology of <em>Pygmalion</em> and <em>Galatea</em>. But although, Pygmalion did fell in love with his creation, Shaw refused to let his creation be just a mere reiteration of the same old story. In this play, Mr. Higgins, harboring his intense hatred towards women (an indicator of the misogynistic society at that time), never falls in love, although he did admit to having &ldquo;grown accustomed to her face&rdquo;. And perhaps, the greatest triumph of Shaw in Pygmalion is the last couple of pages of Act 5 where, unlike her Greek counterpart, Eliza stands up for her rights and dignity, putting to good use the same lessons of articulation and speech that her teacher had taught her. Shaw saw Eliza, not merely as another &ldquo;live doll&rdquo; to be manipulated by English men but a tender and thoughtful independent woman. It is such a delight to read through Higgins and her conversation where she systematically dismantles the falsely assumed pedastal of Higgin&rsquo;s English superiority and presents her concerns and demands to him. And I think Pygmalion is a brilliant play, if for nothing then just that.</p></div></details></li></ol><h2 id=unfinished>Unfinished</h2><p>Anything read more than 5% but less than 100% is noted here.
