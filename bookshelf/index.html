The Beats are difficult to define but loosely refer to the bad body of hobos, bums, and con men who were a product of the Depression of the 30s. Young, promising, and full of dreams but without a penny in pocket. As Jack so eloquently puts it, “All he needed was one wheel on his hand and four wheels on the road”. And that is a lovely definition of what this book is all about. It is rich and rich with experiences and stories that will never make a conversation go boring at dinner time and so full of sadness and melancholy at the same time. Told from the perspective of Jack’s alter ego, Sal Paradise, a wannabe writer from New York who befriends a rapturous Beat of the generation, Dean Moriarty, modelled after his friend, Neal Cassidy, the book is a wild account of what it means to be Beat and lost and still somehow find a way. They escape on daring adventures and hitchhike around the American wilderness from coast to coast, meeting old friends, making new ones, conning people, and making sure to make the most of their limited lives that are going by. Kerouac holds back nothing and there’s everything from whores and sex to drugs, and parties, and arrests and the law and brilliant descriptions of America that would make any lacklustre soul quiver with curiosity.</p><p>On a personal note, I accompanied the book with a map of the US and found myself staring at it and wondering about all those little nameless towns that were not marked on it and the little stories people would tell there and the adventures people would have on the road. As Sal said, the “road is life” and as Dean proclaimed, “we must make time”!</p><p>PS: I wonder if there is an Indian equivalent for the same but I highly doubt it and perhaps, there is a need for one and perhaps, it is time for the Indian youth to wake up to that inner call of the wilderness after all.</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none><strong>The Kite Runner | Khaled Hosseini</strong></summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>&ldquo;The Kite Runner&rdquo; is Khaled Hosseini&rsquo;s debut novel which deals with the plights and concerns of Afghanistan. Hosseini, himself taken citizenship in the US and working as a doctor, may perhaps have been the first to draw the international attention of nation states to the condition, massacre, and oppression in Afghanistan via his riveting and heart-wrenching fictions that, undoubtedly, draw from real as well as personal experiences.</p><p>To read &ldquo;The Kite Runner&rdquo; after &ldquo;A Thousand Splendid Suns&rdquo; felt like flipping the pages of a diary <em>backwards</em>. When one starts writing, they are less nuanced and more reckless. In ATSS, Hosseini presents an extremely layered story with vivid details. I felt that layered nuance lacking in TKR which is forgivable given it is his debut and I read them in the wrong order.</p><p>But do not be misled into assuming that the book doesn&rsquo;t pack a punch. Hosseini may have been frivolous with language and structure at places but occassionally, just occassionally, he would write a sentence that would suck the life out of me, make me close the book, take a deep forceful breath to rebalance myself, and ponder. He doesn&rsquo;t fail to jerk tear off of you merely by his command of word and his gift as an exceptional storyteller.</p><p>It sure took me a while to read TKR. The last of his book remains to be read.</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none><strong>Pygmalion | George Bernard Shaw</strong></summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5">I wrote a blogpost [here][7].</div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none><strong>Mrs. Warren&rsquo;s Profession | George Bernard Shaw</strong></summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none><strong>Sputnik Sweetheart | Haruki Murakami</strong></summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Hmmm meh. Personally, I am more of a realist and Murakami&rsquo;s writing about fantasy and supernormal phenomena simply didn&rsquo;t make the cut. I felt like puking to be honest (and no offense to the person). I liked Kerouac&rsquo;s OTR much more simply because of its raw realism.</p><p>Okay, rant over. SS is a fantastical love triangle essentially. Without a resolution, it tells us the beginning and the middle of how two love stories came into being and never really took off. I think the lack of an ending like one of those Romantic novels is perhaps the only bit of realism that I could relate too. Also, to give credit when it&rsquo;s due, I liked his monologue ramblings especially those by the first person narrator. He asks some good questions there. A mediocre read overall. Perhaps, Norwegian Woods have been better. I don&rsquo;t know.</p></div></details></li></ol><h2 id=unfinished>Unfinished</h2><p>Anything read more than 5% but less than 100% is noted here.
