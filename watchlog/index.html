The sounds hit us before any visuals. And the first shot is a blurry evidently very 2000ish footage of a tense old woman being informed of the birth of her granddaughter. But the news had turned her gloomy and threw her off-guard. She shows denial of the information and asks te nurse to recheck in obvious disbelief. The scan showed that it was a boy.</p><p>The Circle is an evidently low-budget film, it almost feels amateur in its technique an choices and yet it derives it spoptency from the vision that it imbibes. It brings the plights of the Iranian women and the oppressive patriarchal system that has justified and sustainedthe oppression. The Circle is an incredibly nuance take on the Iranian treatment of women and a strong feminist film. But the peculiar part is that it doesn&rsquo;t force itself to identify as one. The plot follows a number of Iranian women who seem to be casually going through their daily lives and that IS what constitutes the oppression. Even the daily lives of women are fraught with inequalities and obvious mistreatment and absurd laws.</p><p>The camera used in The Circle is reminiscient of an era gone by and stands as a testimony to the rapid development of technology. The camera is itself a pinhole into a time long gone. However, I&rsquo;m afraid such liberation statements cannot be made by the strong and beautiful women of Iran.</p></div></details></li><li>The Piano Teacher | Micheal Haneke | 2001</li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Inside Llweyn Davis | Coen Brothers | 2013</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><h3 id=inside-llewyn-davis-is-a-realist-melodramatic-folk-ride>&ldquo;Inside Llewyn Davis&rdquo; is a realist melodramatic folk ride</h3><p>When the last sequence of ILD unfolded, I realised something was off about it. The same sequence that started the film ended it but to complete the loop by retelling what led to the opening sequence (like most other films do) but by positioning the exact same sequence as stemming from the opening sequence thus completing the loop in a rather unique way where it seems like the protagonist, Llewyn Davis is stuck in a time loop. I had to rewind just to confirm this fact. As the end credits started rolling, I was gripped by an easy but satisfying feeling that the plot has reached a resolution but uneasy because perhaps, the reconciliation hasn&rsquo;t been in a way I had expected. But then again, I am hardly surprised. The Coen brothers have a way of lending a peculiar touch to their characters and writing and an unabiding ending - take for example: No Country For Old Men when Anton Chirugh simply walks away into broad daylight without being captured or even Fargo with its dark and bloody ending in a movie with already considerable bloodshed.</p><p>ILD focuses on just one man - the titular Llewyn Davis, a bum unemployed, former sailor who puts together a living by singing folk songs at The Gaslight. The era is the 1960s so communism is still a hotbed of debate and discussion. Llewyn is what I would call a picture perfect example of a failed man - he has no job, might have gotten a married friend pregnant (and has to pay for her abortion), has a dysfunctional relation with his father, cannot keep hold of a cat, doesn&rsquo;t know how to behave socially and is bad-tempered, and so on and on. The story is poignant in a way because it is deeply rooted in reality - it&rsquo;s a realist story. And perhaps that is why it is so relatable. A modern man caught in the crossfire of his dreams and his livelihood, stuck up in metal cages to go for auditions that fail. A man with a strong opinion on how songs should be but not quite making it like one of the giants - a man with a vision but not the means to realise those visions. And at some point, I think we all have been there and watched as things go by and forced to stay quiet.</p><p>Obvious comparison can be made with Whiplash and The Black Swan and the trope of the obssesive artist with Llewyn embodying the unwavering belief in his art. And yet, it differs. As Llewyn comes full circle and takes up the sailor job that he hates with such enmity and when he confides in Jean - &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired&rdquo;. A comparison may also be drawn with Ryan Gosling starrer &ldquo;Drive&rdquo; with a major difference - ILD is an anti-sigma male story.</p><p>With commendable performance from Oscar Isaac (seen this man from Star Wars to Drive) and that cheeky Adam Driver thingie with Al Cody (man from Marriage Story to Paterson), I think, if for nothing, I can come back for the folk songs :)</p></div></details></li><li>Atonement | Joe Wright | 2007</li><li>The Fellowship of the Ring (LOTR #1) | Peter Jackson | 2001</li><li>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days | Donald Petrie | 2003</li><li>12 Angry Men | Sidney Lumet | 1957</li><li>The Two Towers (LOTR #2) | Peter Jackson | 2002</li><li>Return of the King (LOTR #3) | Peter Jackson | 2003</li><li>Andhadhun | Sriram Madhanvan | 2018</li><li>Shaun of the dead | Edgar Wright | 2004</li><li>The Departed | Martin Scorcese | 2006</li></ol><h1 id=2022>2022</h1><ol><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Fallen Angels | Wong Kar-Wai | 1995</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>In Fallen Angels, Wong Kar-Wai perfects and consolidates his unique style that he introduced in Chungking Express. Every shot is so dreamy and trippy from the steadicam camerawork (something taken by Gaspar Noe to the extreme) to jittery, grainy compositions with colors split midway. Fallen Angels is among one of the most stylized films I have watched till date. A movie with a distinct taste and sophistication.</p><p>Fallen Angels follows different individuals from different walks of lifes in Hong Kong and how their paths cross in serendipitous ways. It’s a dreamy film and takes that premise forward. I loved the stop-motion bounty murder sequences (an exceptional such sequence is the Plutonium theft sequence in The Man Who Stole the Sun), the camera movements are humorous, perky, and….comical. It’s delightful to hit play on any Wong Kar-Wai and let our minds drift into his world. Revisitable.</p><p>(first watch: 14 December, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Once Upon A Time&mldr;In Hollywood | Quentin Tarantino | 2019</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood takes place in Hollywood in the 60s and tells the story of a fictional actor named Rick Dalton and his stuntman double, Cliff Booth. They happen to be neighbors to Roman Polanski and Shannon Tate (played by Margot Robbie) and end up getting engaged in a number of internal and external conflicts such as career issues, fight with the hippies, and so on.</p><p>The movie is a portrayal of the bourgeois Hollywood circles and a social commentary on the good ol’ have and have-nots. All filmed in classic Tarantino style. We have everything from feet to food to fight scenes with “Bruce Lee”. Car drives form a large portion in the first half and peculiar hovering bird-eye view shots too. And then, of course, the finale and confrontation at Rick’s house. And a special mention for Margot Robbie, oof :P!</p><p>I like how the film mingles the real life and the film life. Gave me a lot of Truffaut’s Day For Night vibes. All in all, a good watch for a lazy Saturday evening.</p><p>(first watch: 10 December, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion | Elio Petri | 1970</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion begins with the murder of a beautiful woman, Augusta Terzi (Florinda Bolkan), with a severe rape-and-murder fetish by her police chief lover. Interestingly, the chief doesn’t try to cover his tracks but instead place evidences so that the police can trace the murder to him. And yet, even more intriguingly, the police chooses to unsee the evidence and defer the investigation simply because the culprit is a man of power. Indeed, the chief exclaims (multiple times) – “I represent power, Augusta!” The film questions state authority and machismo as the investigation unfolds against a youth-led communist uprising challenging the state dominance, which is most brilliantly represented by one of the most potent scenes – the interrogation of the plumber. One must notice the dialogues very carefully as they drip with irony and fear. It’s one of the most riveting demonstrations of the power of state authority and a starking representation of the theme of the movie. Shot in intimate full face shots, it’s upclose and personal. We can study each muscle twitch of the face. Fantastically executed. Perhaps, the single dialogue that summarizes the state’s attitude is this: “We must know everything. We must control everything.” The movie is also the commentary on the psychological transition of a man who is given incredible power to exercise. He breaks the traffic light and gets away with it. Terzi exclaims, “You can commit any crime you want” and we are left to ponder: Who will watch the watchmen?</p><p>Coming to execution, Investigation has some of the finest camerawork I have seen. Scene compositions are great, the camera movement graceful as they sway around a scene intriguing and creating suspense. I don’t know much about Italian cinema (I’m reminded of Life is Beautiful) but I suppose this will be up there. Complementary and “humorous” sound track. Love the flashback sequences.</p><p>(first watch: 28 November, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Pan&rsquo;s Labyrinth | Guillermo del Toro | 2006</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Oh. My. God. Pan’s Labyrinth is a beautiful, chilling modern fairy tale story. But don’t believe “fairy tale” means all unicorns and magic spells - although, Pan’s Labyrinth doesn’t lack in imagination - there are more twists and moments of heightened suspense than in any conventional flick. Beautifully shot, the lighting are amazing, the color palettes, and the cinematography. And of course, the CGI. A very Alice in Wonderful-like plot but nothing like it. It has ample gore and bloodshed and death and magic creatures and fairies and fauns. Incredible experience.</p><p>Set in the Spanish civil war, it follows a little girl who discovers she is a magical princess but must perform three tasks to prove her fairyhood. Instead of spoiling the plot for you, I’ll just leave it for you to explore :)</p><p>(first watch: 27 November, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Dogtooth | Yorgos Lanthimos | 2009</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>What is Dogtooth? To be honest, I don’t know. Is it a work of genius or just another director’s brain fart? Is there a deeply embedded and profound message in the film or are we just left to our devices to find one where none exists? It is hard to say. It is set in a Parasite-esque sprawling residence complete with all amentities where the parents have brainwashed their three children into confining them to the house. They go to great lengths to do the same, reinventing words and changing their meanings (“Zombie” is a small yellow flower, for example), faking the death of their imaginary brother by a evil creature called the “cat”. It’s a film that contains many explicit scenes of violence, gore, and blood - Martin, the boy gorging out the guts of a cat with gardener’s scissors or the eldest smashing her mouth with a dumbell to get her dogtooth out - afterwards which she’s told she would be able to venture out and face the challenges of the world outside. Not a lot seems to be happening in the film - these characters moving around in slow and calculated steps, the cameras held in static shots as if everybody is holding their breaths and its kind of ironic given the pristine environment they live in. But once we look deeper, we find darker things going on in the house. Themes of submission are generously explores throughout the film along with incest and homosexuality. The climax is open-ended as we find the eldest girl being able to identify the shroud of lies her parents have put up and escaping out in her father’s car but we don’t really find out what happens to her afterwards. The last shot is a long take of her father’s backcabin. And that’s pretty much all I wanna say about Dogtooth. Weird-ass Greek movie.</p><p>(first watch: 26 November, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Stuck in Love | Josh Boone | 2012</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Stuck in Love combines literature and romance into a feel-good flick where defective characters eventually “find themselves” via experiences of love and beyond. It follows a family of a successful writer father who has been divorced for three years but finds it hard to move on. His two kids, a shy teenager boy who loves Stephen King and is socially awkward and his promiscous daughter who simply refuses to believe in love and dating because of the scars her parent’s separation left on her. It’s a story where characters eventually gain understanding, perspective, and clarity that the meaning of love is different for everyone. It ends on a happy note so there’s that. Loved the literature references such as ref to “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love” by Raymond Craver where he ends,</p><blockquote><p>I could hear my heart beating. I could hear everyone’s heart. I could hear the human noise we sat there making, not one of us moving, not even when the room went dark. ~What We talk About When We Talk About Love, Raymond Craver</p></blockquote><p>Wow.</p><p>And how Flannery O’ Connor, an American novelist and essayist said that the first 20 years of experiences is enough to inspire a writer for the rest of their creative output. I sooo love this.</p><p>PS: It had Jennifer Connelly in it. gasp</p><p>(first watch: 25 November, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Napoleon Dynamite | Jared Hess | 2004</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Hmm, how do I describe Napoleon Dynamite? It’s a funky movie set in the middle of nowhere of Idaho and follows the titular character of Napoleon Dynamite who is far, far away from being anything close to a dynamite. Infact, characters seem to be in semi-sleep deprived state ironic given the title of the film. With very minimal and almost no action, NB manages to irk out some laughs and certainly some chuckles with clever writing and a slapstick-esque comedy style. It’s stupid and wacky and feels senseless but once you see it, you realise that is the beauty of it.</p><p>It’s a story with profound plotlines and memorable characters. It’s about finding love beyond barriers (The hilarious Lawfunduh and Kip tale), and priding in being the underestimated, neglected underdog who rises when the time is ripe. It’s a hilarious movie and worth watching just for the sake of Napoleon and the kind of (mis)adventures he is a part of.</p><p>PS: They also made an animated 6 episode series out of this.</p><p>(first watch: 24 November, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>The Man Who Stole The Sun | Kazuhiko Hasegawa | 1979</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>The Man Who Stole The Sun is a Japanese dark humour comedy which follows a meek school science teacher who ends up making an atomic bomb in his apartment and quite literally brings the whole Tokyo state police to its knees. It is a deeply engaging movie with a lot of plot twists and thought-provoking events. With some wacky and interesting editing, the stop-motion theft of plutonium from the reactor sequence comes to mind, the shot composition, and the overall cinematography in this film is top-notch.</p><p>There is a bit of everything in this ~150 minutes long film – action squences, car chases, murder, gore, romance, comedy, music. TMWSTS explores two very different themes – the anguish and determination in the life of a lonely young man. Who wouldn’t sympathise with Mr. Kido AKA the A-bomb man, #9, and Bubblegum when Inspector Yamashita yells in the end scene, “That’s who you really want to kill-it’s you!”? At the same time, we get a glimpse into the destituted and utterly inept condition of state authority as they try in vain to nab the perpretrator. We are forced to question ourselves, What good is it to rest our trust for security in a state institution like this?</p><p>I loved the soundtrack in this movie. It was layered and beautifully executed. And the shots, ah. Whatever be the case, right out there with the likes of Akira and Spirited Away, TMWSTS is a classic Japanese flick that is an eye-candy to watch.</p><p>PS: I got to know about this rather obscure film (and many others) via this newly discovered YT channel called The Kino Corner. Check out their video too!

It is Billy Wilder’s crazy experiment into creating a cinematic flick that would attract a cinema-going audience and also manage to establish him as a visionary in American film landscape. Double Indemnity, at its heart, is a tale of trust and deceit. Characters build trust and end up both betraying and getting betrayed simultaneously. A healthy dose of 50s American slang, sometime getting too mentally jarring to comprehend. Signature Wilder with his cocky weird-ass jokes that would be better received by an audience of the 50s, I guess.</p><p>All in all, a nice continuation of exploring Wilder’s works.</p><p>(first watch: 19 November, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>The Truman Show | Peter Weir | 1998</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5">The Truman Show is an avant-garde piece of cinematic writing. It asks deep questions in an innocuous disguise. There are many clever references as treats for the inquisitive ones. And, it is a most wholesome of the so-called “happy endings”. I loved the unconventional voyeuristic camerawork that delibrately gave out the impression of being watch. That coupled with sneaky writing on the events and plotline lend extra suspense as we knew something was off from the beginning but couldn’t really manage to place it. TTS does a great job of arresting that suspense in a fulfilling manner. Questions of morality, personal freedom, the television, internet, online voyeurism, tracking, social engineering, illusion, facade, and so much more, just pours out of the premise itself. I’m sure, something new will come out of TTS everytime one sits to watch it and it will lead to a healthy amount of debate and discussion everytime.

It follows a forgotten, old actress, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who lives in her own imaginative fiction where she believes she is still adored by her fans, and respected by her colleagues. The progression and eventual breakdown of her mental psyche makes up the core plotline for the film. On the other hand, we have a struggling screenwriter who stumbles upon her palace of comfort and seclusion and ends up becoming a follower/submissive?. He is trying to come to terms with his inability to “make it big” and accepting his failure with resignation. The internal conflict of these characters form an interesting dynamic throughout the film and presents multiple real-world conundrums through it. The characters are very well-developed and presented. A shoutout for Ms. Desmond’s house which is an exquisite example of a mise-en-scene. The film is engaging and keeps one on the edge and yet is not horrific. It asks deep questions through the characters and invites us to understand their plights. To all the praises I have heard about SB, I think it deserves all.</p><p>The element of a dashing broke male protagonist becoming the object of affection for a plural number of attractive females or vice-versa (As seen in Some Like It Hot) seems to me a popular story device of the 50s. Here too, we see Betty Shaefer and Norma Desmond fall for our charming little gentleman, Joe Gillis. As a matter of fact, I found little misogynistic comments / dialogues than Some Like It Hot which seems to be a mark of the era rather than the director’s mindset themselves.</p><p>(first watch: 8 November, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li>Some Like It Hot | Billy Wilder | 1959</li><li>The Usual Suspects | Byran Singer | 1995</li><li>Spirited Away | Hayao Miyazaki | 2001</li><li>The Double Life of Veronique | Krzysztof Kieslowski | 1991</li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>The Big Lebowski | Coen Brothers | 1998</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>TBL is a evident departure by the Coen brothers from their element and yet threads close to the spirit of a Coen production. It is a comedy-drama that follows a Jeffrey Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), a pot-bellied, failed bum, who joins his friends, Donny and Walter, in bowling tournaments diligently (and pretty much nothing else). But things go awry when two rogues come and piss on his rug, mistaking him for another Jeffrey Lebowski, a namesake and a more accomplished individual with considerable reputation and a hot-chick wife who is in debt from a Mr. Jackie Treehorn. Our Jeff or “Dude” as he likes to be called, is slowly embroiled in a progression of different cacophonies. And that is essentially it, a million dollars in ransom, a kidnapped wife and a quest to bring her back.</p><p>TBL works for its very well-written characters, tidy cinematography, and story-telling. Walter Sobchak is a truly eccentric character, a short-tempered good-for-nothing who manages to fail in everything and bring the Vietnam war into every conversation. A man who loves rules and gets real upset real fast if he finds people flunking rules, Walter is just one example of a memorable and eccentric character. Infact every character lends a unique charm to every scene and create a humorous environment overall. This is a departure from the usual Coen characters who create a chilling aura on screen (Anton Chigurh from No country for old men).</p><p>Enjoyed it. Oh, and Julianne Moore. And that opening bowling game scene in slow-motion chef’s kiss.</p><p>(first watch: 21 October, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Punch Drunk Love | P. T. Anderson | 2002</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Hmm. I remember starting this movie way back and leaving it around the 30 minutes mark because nothing seemed to be happening. Now, that was quite naive of me but on a second attempt, I understood that those first 30 minutes in a 90 minute film does tell the story by not telling any.</p><p>Punch Drunk Love is a simple and profound story of love and finding love. It is essentially a brilliantly told character transformation story. We meet Barry, our protagonist and immediately figure that something is off. He’s heckling a customer care line about how their frequent flyer offer outvalues the price of the product monetarily. Not talkative, small brother with seven sisters, scruffy around people, anxious about social gathering, wearing a suit at 8am(!), everything seems strange about him. Some really cool shots worth mentioning are the piano stealing scene and the three cut shots of Barry looking down at the piano from three sides. It’s so beautifully executed. Barry is a lonely grown-up man with a crying problem. He loses his temper often and ends up kicking and shattering glass at her sister’s birthday. There is a beautiful shot of Barry with drooped head and Anderson pans the camera to the left to reveal an empty dinner table (typically where loved ones converse) showing how lonely he is. Again, brilliantly done. He’s talking to his brother-in-law and talks about how “I don’t like myself sometimes” and “I don’t have someone I can talk to about things” and “I sometimes cry a lot for no reason.” Now, these are serious issues and very much real in today’s society. Anderson is talking about real condition of real men in the real world. There’s this line “Everybody would be there and I’d get a little tense and I won’t act like myself” and I broke a little inside.</p><p>As much as it is a story of Barry, let’s talk about the agent that brought about his transformation. Lena Leonard, the woman in the red dress. The more she got to know him, the more she accepted him, something he needed. Being caught in the wrong company by a phone-sex line gang, after he falls in love with Lena, he goes all the way to Utah from L.A. just to tell the guy that he’s not afraid of anything because he has someone who loves him. It’s not so much as telling the guy but telling himself. That’s something he has been wanting to listen to and now, it’s there. This is where he derives his new-found power from. No more the timid, hesistant, and awkward Barry. But have I talked about the single most memorable shot of this film? Yes! The Hawaiian rendezvous! The framing and composition, the choice of silhoutte, the body language, omg! It blew my mind really.</p><p>PS: I saw this movie featured in a StudioBinder video on yt and got reminded of leaving it midway so here we are.</p><p>(first watch: 09 October, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Minority Report | Steven Spielberg | 2002</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>If you ask me to describe Minority Report, I’ll call it a movie of ideas. Directed by Spielberg, it’s a testimony to changing times, changing technology, and Spielberg responding to that change (Ready Player One anyone?). Based on a Philip K. Dick short story (yes, this guy seems to supply most of our sci-fi plots), we are introduced to the Department of Precrime whose job is to stop perpetrators before they commit the crime. They are able to do this with the help of three “Pre-cogs”, surviving humans from a failed genetic experiment with a superpower. The movie is highly debatable and thought-provoking asking the obvious questions of the morality involved in arresting someone before they commit any crime and the difficult question of choice, free-will, and determination. As someone explained, the Pre-cogs don’t show what you intend to do but what you are going to do. So, when John Ardenton (Tom Cruise), the officer in Precrime gets to know he’s gonna murder someone, he starts a chain of events that with the intention of preventing that event, will inevitable lead him to it.</p><p>Setting these questions aside, we come to the engaging story because it is essentially a crime thriller with a Christie-esque (God, I have to work on my portmanteaus!) whodunnit undertones. It got fairly predictable towards the climax but it was entertaining for the better part.</p><p>Spielberg manages to paint a “plausible” futuristic vision in this film where “plausible” is defined (tongue-in-cheek by me) as not cringe enough to make me gawk but acceptable. It is a loose definition by intention as it is difficult to predict the future (no pun intended :P). Impressive computer interfaces, futuristic cars, a centrally surveillanced city system, advanced law-and-order equipments, it was cool.</p><p>Now, coming to direction and cinematography. The building surveillance scene with spyders while Ardenton is on the run is nicely shot in bird-eye view. It’s a brilliant decision because the nature of the policemen is voyeuristic / intruding and nothing could have captured that better than a God-like bird-eye shot of the residents. This is just one example I can think of right now. Engaging camerawork. Loved it.</p><p>(first watch: 09 October, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li>13 going on 30 | Gary Winick | 2004</li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>A Clockwork Orange | Stanley Kubrick | 1971</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><h2 id=a-clockwork-orange-is-kubricks-realisation-of-an-orwellian-fantasy>&ldquo;A Clockwork Orange&rdquo; is Kubrick&rsquo;s realisation of an Orwellian fantasy</h2><p>Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange tries to be many things in a nifty way. A satire on state control, a study of the effervescent youth, and an outlandish extol of the Ninth Symphony. Set in Britain, Orange is an English film using a made-up vocabulary derived from Russian that is delightful to listen to. With sentences such as: “Come and get one in the yarbles if you have any yarbles you eunuch jelly, thou”, and words like “malenky”, “rassoodocks”, “devotchka”, one would want to simply keep listening to it.</p><h3 id=plot>PLOT</h3><p>Alexander DeLarge is a troubled, delinquent charming youth with an extended appetite for knifing, violence, sex, and rapes. Along with three accomplices - Pete, Dim, and Georgie, they embark on daring nightly criminal enterprises and find themselves wealthy both monetarily and carnally. With beating up bums on the street, breaking into homes to rape wifes in front of their husbands, robbery, and every progressive crime so heinous and inciting in nature, we start to disgust Alex, at the very least. But life is good for Alex, a meek set of parents, Basil, his pet snake for company, and music, oh yes, especially Ludwig van’s Ninth Symphony that he so adores. It is only after a failed theft and accidental murder of the victim that Alex finds himself sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment, a term that he despises. He is tortured and manhandled in the cells and the brutality of prison life soon makes us symphathise with our poor Alex. A poor, young lad, albeit slightly lost. Isn’t he? So, when the opportune time comes to sign up for a new psychological treatment — Ludivico treatment — by the Government in accord with its new agenda of not punishing criminals, but to “cure” them altogether, Alex jumps at the opportunity — not so much as for a sincere remorse for his past but as a means of escape from the “hellhole and human zoo”. It might not be forward of us to think of Alex as Kubrick’s own toy, a vehicle he yields to sway our sentiments at will.</p><h3 id=the-ludivico-treatment>THE LUDIVICO TREATMENT</h3><p>This is an interesting juncture of the film wherein the oppressive and impulsive Alex is turned into a submissive, meek, subordinate via a brutal fourteen-day regime of brainwashing, and chemically conditioned repulsion for violence and (accidentally) music, especially Ninth Symphony that so poignantly accompanied the videos on Holocaust and Nazis as they were shown to Alex with eyelid-locked apparatus. What emerged out of this is a totally different man, one who won’t advance for the usual “good in-out” on an inviting naked woman but go so far as to lick the boot of an oppressor if asked to do so. And it is this moment that we begin to question the rationality and effectiveness of the method adopted by the Government. Yes, Alex is permanently conditioned to denounce crime and violence but where has the state left him the power of decision. He might not be the first to start a fight but what is alarming is the realisation that he won’t be able to defend himself if he finds himself in one. Thus, the much-lauded brainwashing technique is reduced to a masquerading method to turn the masses into submissive, little cattle. You might have guessed where Kubrick is going with this. Such procedure, if conducted en masse with the determination and resources easily accessible to the state, would surely pave the way for a totalitarian, state-controlled regime with no dissent against the dictator. An Orwellian fantasy realised.</p><h3 id=plot-continued>PLOT CONTINUED</h3><p>But oh, I digress much from our good, ol’ Alex, one who is forever robbed of experiencing the joys of the Ninth. The reformation does come at a cost. And it is shown most vividly by his rendezvous with his old accomplices, Dim and Georgie, who have now assumed the post of police-officers, young and brash, just how the Government would like the law-enforcers to be. The meeting isn’t pleasant. Old balance books are settled. And Alex, left to his own accord, finds himself at the cozy residence of none other than the revolting writer whose wife he had wronged. Alex reasons that due to his proboscis mask at the time of crime, the man won’t be unable to identify him straight away. But he does. And we know it. Particulaly impressed by Kubrick who manages to hold the suspense so properly in this scene. A suicide attempt by Alex goes awry after he is locked in a room and tortured by the Ninth, a remote-control, a vulnerability deliberately introduced by the state. With broken bones, he lays on his hospital bed, only to be visited by Minister of the Interior, the champion of the Ludivico technique. An understanding is reached between the two as “friends” and we are left to ponder the meaning of it all as a wild rape fantasy pops into Alex’s head making us ask the question, “What changed?”</p><h3 id=themes-and-motifs>THEMES AND MOTIFS</h3><p>Orange is ambitious in the range of themes it tries to portray and comment on. Now, let’s proceed to dismantle the many motifs and references, something to always look forward to in a Kubrick. The first thing that I noticed was the usage of a peculiar vocabulary, a peculiarity that is closer to amusement just by the acoustic qualities of the sounds. The most provoking motif, although not a special one, is Kubrick’s fetish with bare female skin (Eyes Wide Shut unmistakenly comes to mind) and the need to explicitly display it, as a celebration of the female form or just a perverted downslide, that we may may never know. Classical music adorns the background score of a greater part of the movie and the dramatic and impressive usage of music to complement grosteque scenes of violence and assault is again very Kubrick-esque. Circling back to, perhaps, the most visually noticeable feature that is the mise-en-scene. There is general consensus as to the importance that Kubrick associates with his set design, props, and lighting. We are reminded of the rebellious writer’s quirky and modernist house, an unforgettable piece of interior designing. Same goes for Mr. DeLarge’s residence and the arousing Korova Milk Bar. The brilliant usage of bright and saturated colors along with patterns and motifs goes a long way in consolidating the images in the viewer’s head a long time after the movie is over, something Kubrick knew and exploited to his advantage well.</p><p>And sample this dialogue of Alex with an old roadside bum who he later thrashes:</p><blockquote><p>Bum: It&rsquo;s no world for an old man any longer.<br>What kind of a world is it at all?<br>Men on the moon.<br>Men spinning around the earth.<br>And there&rsquo;s not no attention paid&mldr;<br>&mldr;to earthly law and order no more.</p></blockquote><p>Nothing the usage of the Cockney English, delight for the ears to listen but not much practical. This is the style adopted throughout the script. This particular dialogue stands apart because there isn’t anything along this spirit in the movie, the regurgitory rant of the old against the new world order, that is.</p><h4 id=conclusion>CONCLUSION</h4><p>Ah, so much analysis but are we left with anything more than what we came here with? Perhaps not. The highly effective Ludivico technique is (thankfully) fictional but does it imply the absence of a eqaully potent technique out there currently employed by so-called law-enforcers? Is it morally correct or even beneficial to punish the offenders? Or will it make more sense to “cure” them? ACO asks a lot of questions or maybe none at all. But who cares if it is good cinema, innit?</p><p>PS: Kinda ironic I’m composing this while listening to van Beethoven’s Ninth hehe.</p><p>PPS: Alex’s pet snake is named Basil. Can you believe that?! I’m immortalised in a Kubrick film. Still feels unreal man.

TKF is a hard polarising movie if consumed without context or history and thus, a conveniently dangerous trigger for the impulsive youths. Facts are heavily distorted, sometimes even changed just to fit a one-sided narrative that Agnihotri has tried to propagate in this movie. Ironically enough, in a movie which likened the Kashmiri Pandit exodus to nothing less than the Holocaust, I could safely argue that that movie is infact a propaganda film aimed less at narrating an unbiased history but creating disbalance and enmity in society.</p><p>Clocking at a whooping ~170 minutes of runtime, the story of Kashmiri Pandits is told in which the sympathy rests solely with the Pandits. A wobbly plot, lame writing, and an incoherent presentation of information makes for a jarring watch if only countered by impressive performances by a relatively star-studded cast. Anupam Kher as a distraught Kashmiri Pandit comes to mind. Suboptimal acting by the protag made me cringe but it is Bollywood after all and we cannot escape drama. The legacy, lore, and myth of Kashmir was presented in a manner that seemed more to mock the audience for not knowing such an important piece of Kashmir’s legacy than to provide that information. There is considerable gore and blood shown with explicit scenes of assault and murder. Again, the objective seemed less to provide context to an “unbiased” telling of the history (which was, of course, absent) but to instigate a new generation of youth into cornering a certain section of the society as malicious. Yes, a piece of Agnihotri’s fetishized reality.</p><p>In all the crossfire, Faiz’s poetry Hum Dekhenge is distorted to conveniently fit into the narrative by invoking traditional Islamist fundamentalist views and somehow managing to interpret the poetry in that light. In his rallying to identify with the plight of Kashmiri Pandits, Agnihotri manages to paint a more blood-bathed picture of the Valley than the paradise that it really is.</p><p>In conclusion, my original advice of consuming his movie with considerable perspective and context is essential to sift facts from fiction. Or to not consume this movie altogether.</p><p>(first watch: 5 October, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Moonrise Kingdom | Wes Anderson | 2012</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Unlike other Wes Anderson movies, Moonrise Kingdom is a profound inquiry into the psychological tendencies of young children. It explores the themes of orphans and disturbed childhood. But of course, it raises these serious issues in Anderson’s light-hearted, peculiarly comical manner. We get what Anderson is telling us but don’t get overwhelmed. The message is there, it’s just a little subtle.</p><p>We follow Mr. Sam Shakusky, an orphaned twelve-year old Boy Scout who resigns from his position to rendezvous with his love interest, Ms. Suzy Bishop, an emotionally perturbed tweleve-year old girl who Sam had the chance to fancy at a performance where she played, conveniently, the raven. Their elopement was not spontaneous but involved an intimate and detailed correspondence via letters that now, Mr. and Ms. Bishop, victims of a failing marriage themselves, as Suzy spots her mother secretly spending time with Captain Sharp, the local Island police, have found and call for a search. With Sam’s exceptional Scout-boy skills and Suzy’s considerable inventory, they spend time on Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet AKA the “Moonrise Kingdom”, only to be separated later by Scout master Ward and Suzy’s parents. The plot gets more involved but in the end, they get back together.</p><p>It’s a sweet and charming children’s movie with a little bit of objectionable material for kids. It portrays that crazy excitement of first love and kissing/being kissed for the first time. The awkwardness, the alienness, and the exhilaration. Charming and poignant in its own way. While at the same time commenting on the mental condition of an orphan who is sent to foster parents who send him to Boy Scout (And who later disown him after they hear that he’s a runaway), and a twelve-year old girl who finds a book titled “Coping with the very troubled child” with her parents. Indeed, books are an integral part of the film as Suzy loves to read books about female leads (that she stole from the library, haha) to Sam. The books, themselves, are not rugged or real but maintain that ornamental “doll-house” quality so common of props in an Anderson film.</p><p>We see two kids, untouched by the corruptions of the world yet, who identify with one another and decide to heal each other just as well. In Moonrise Kingdom, we see a different aspect of Anderson. He celebrates childhood, that transient, innocent time of our lives.</p><p>(first watch: 4 October, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Nocturnal Animals | Tom Ford | 2016</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Nocturnal Animals is an interesting American psychological thriller. It tells the story of a rich and successful art curator who receives a copy of a new book written by her ex-husband whom she left for being less ambitious. As she reads through the story (which is also visually narrated to us), she slowly descends into depression as she realises how wrong she has been. At the end, she tries to redeem her mistake by trying to patch things with her ex-husband as her current marraige is failing and she’s pretty sure her husband is sleeping with other woman. The narrated story is about a man who lost his wife and daughter on the highway to Texas to a bunch of goons and found them raped and murdered later. Partnered with a cancerous police-officer, they manage to find the culprits who are murdered in increasing degrees of gore before he shots himself. So, yeah, kind of a mindfuck. Two parallele narrations and the innovative switched between them is interesting. The impressive use of sound and environment to create an atmosphere of increasing suspense and terror is commendable. Overall, it’s a nice entertainment piece.</p><p>(first watch: 3 October, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>The French Dispatch | Wes Anderson | 2021</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><h2 id=the-french-dispatch-an-absurdist-eye-candy>The French Dispatch: An absurdist eye-candy</h2><p>Wes Anderson is a director whose works when subjected to multiple watching will be rewarding for the audience. Simply because of the sheer amount of information in each scene and shot. Stories that verge on the border of absurdity, most often comical, and seldom dark, coupled with an expansive mise-en-scene and a most peculiar camera style, Wes Anderson has created for himself a very distinctive style, one that is truly his own.</p><h3 id=plot>PLOT</h3><p>In his latest offering, The French Dispatch, he takes us through the hardships and stories behind the publication the final issue of a weekly supplement with the Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun. We kick off with “The Cycling Reporter”, giving us a visual tour of the fictional city of Ennui. He takes the idea of “show don’t tell” and conveniently turns it around into “show and tell”. Then, we are told how “The Concrete Masterpiece” came into being, a chronicle of a genius artist confined in a prison, followed by “Revisions to a Manifesto”, a most peculiar account of a student rebellion and its first-hand account by Mrs. Krementz. We end with a amusing account of the kidnapping of the Commissioner’s son and the quest to bring him back in “The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner”. We end with the obituary, of course, of Mr. Howitzer, the founder and editor of The French Dispatch, who died due to an heart attack.</p><h3 id=elements>ELEMENTS</h3><p>With the extensive use of brilliant shades of pastels, TFD features some of the most delightful set designs. The soft pinks and browns of The Grand Budapest Hotel comes to mind, again. This level of detail warrants multiple watching just to sort of “take in” everything that is happening simultaneously on screen. Characters turn into narrators and they tell the story while peering directly into the camera as if being willingly able to break free of their worlds at will. And the characters, themselves, feel so out of touch with reality, so humorous and absurd and charming that they can only be sourced from a children story-book. Yielding the power of memorable character-writing, Anderson distances himself from the more realist cinema of his contemporary peers.</p><h3 id=camera-and-cinematography>CAMERA and CINEMATOGRAPHY</h3><p>It doesn’t take long to infer the distinct camerawork of Anderson which primarily comprises: panning and trucking shots. These complement, rather well, his expansive set designs that demand to be explored. Just like the audience of a comic book strip, he sends our eyes scanning horizontally as he unfurls the story and reveals information with the progression of the camera.</p><h3 id=conclusion>CONCLUSION</h3><p>With a cast so star-studded, it is a displeasure but not a surprise to find TFD unable to capture the attention of the audience. It is simply because it is not a movie to be watched in the theatres but to be relished again and again from the confines of one’s room. It is a difficult movie to process and rewards multiple viewings.</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Blue Valentine | Derek Cianfrance | 2010</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Blue Valentine is a poignant and melancholic depiction of a failing marriage, a marriage decided circumstantially and in haste. It adopts a bi-narrative style telling the story of how the marriage came to be and how it is painfully disintegrating in the present.

Almost slated to be released in DVD, it was finally released in theaters after much tussle within Warner Bros. Recognized as a sleeper hit, it went on to win 8 Oscars in 2008 - yes, 8, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay.</p><p>SM is a “rags to riches” story of an uneducated 18 year old slumboy named Jamal Malik who went on to win 2 crore rupees on a television show. Suspected of foul play, he is arrested by the police and chronicles his accumulated his experiences of growing up and how he knew all the answers. Visually disturbing and starkly true, SM reminds me of White Tiger but only better. Loved the fairy-tale ending that balances well with the social commentary on the condition of slum kids.

It is also a dark and serious commentary on the ill-treatment of blacks by the whites. Never has such passion erupted in my heart as watching the atrocities meted out to the blacks in this film as any other. It has been a fastastic experience (which QT film isn’t?). Scenes with suspense are so exceptionally composed, one might mistake to not be watching them but actually be in it. There was a tension between the whites and the blacks back in the 1850s. It is the same tension that Tarantino manages to weave into his scenes that lends gravity to the story. (For eg; Periodic pistol-clocking by Django under the table.)</p><p>Django is an exceptional character in its own right. A talented shooter who has a formidable level of confidence and grit. One of the good Western’s out there. (Oh I know, I should finally move my ass to watching The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly but oh well).</p><p>Auf Wiedersehen.</p><p>(first watch: 29 September, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>A Trip to the Moon | Georges Meiles | 1902</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Oh, so finally we’re here. At the beginning. This 15 minute science-fiction short is what most cinema historians consider as the realisation of the art of the moving camera as a form of art. It is plenty evident from the style, presentation, and techniques of an early explorer’s pioneering efforts. As if they are surveying a new found medium, defining new limits and new “laws”. The remnants of theaters are obvious too. Meiles was more of an illusionist than a director just like directors of his era. The idea of expression realism developed much later but the basic gist of cinema remains unchanged (and which we find stark and central stage in ‘Le Voyage das la Lune’): story-telling.</p><p>Georges was an absurdist, and a visionary. There are long static and wide shots, strictly defining the boundaries of what’s in frame and what’s not. The realisation that the frame itself can be dynamic through the film was unknown to these early adopters. The claustrophobic shots is one of the features that stood out for me, along with interesting camera trickery that gave varied effects on screen (superimposition of the human face on the moon, perhaps one of the most iconic cinematic images). It is ironic to think how just seventy years from when we specualated of going to the moon, we actually did go to the moon.</p><p>Another interesting exercise, as I was led to believe online, is an interpretation of ATTTM. Most accepted theory is Meiles criticizing man as a bringer of chaos and highlights the destructive nature of man. They “invaded” moon and crashed into the moon-people uninvited. We may choose to laud these gentlemen on Earth for their accomplishment and bravery, but as soon as images of the moustacheod professor/astronaut spanking moon-residents with his umbrella kicks in as they disappear in a puff of smoke, we are led to rethink our zeal. After the end of 15 minutes as we stare at the tall statue of the astronaut, we are led to think what have they actually accomplished?</p><p>(first watch: 27 September, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Reservoir Dogs | Quentin Tarantino | 1992</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>A bank robbery gone wrong.

The story picks from this point where characters deliberate, ponder, and fight over the existence and identity of an undercover cop amongst them.

I think this dialogue summarizes Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock’s seminal 1960 work investigating the human tendency to bend towards evil and malice. Marion found herself commiting theft and betraying her boss of 10 years just for some money. Bates is a most interesting character for analysis. A lonely, young man who is something of a goof (or atleast that was our first impression of him). With strong the-boy-next-door vibes, he casually puts his hands in his jeans, shows genuine concern for his customers, and radiates that infectious smile all around. And then of course, Bates’ mother, the central enigma of the film. I’ll argue we all have a Mrs. Bate equivalent in ourselves (if you know what I mean) and it is this connection that gives such massive appeal to Psycho almost 60 years after its release. Hitchcock brings together our most primal fears and serves them to us in a shocking and mesmerizing platter.</p><h3 id=cinematography>CINEMATOGRAPHY</h3><p>The shower murder scene is one of the most iconic shots in cinematic history and for a reason, indeed. It showed posterity how actions can be shot. By making the audience a part of the scene (an idea Hitchcock was a big fan of). The jump cuts, the scream, the grimacing face of Marion, the glint of the knife, and the blood flowing down the drain. It’s just so meticulously done. Psycho has its share of glass-ceiling breaking moments when Hitchcock kills off the heroine of the film one-third way through the film. A shocking decision that only intrigues us more. The second murder of the private detective Argobast, is cool in itself, a bird-eye shot of the event captured in its entirety, spontaneity and all. The usage of reverse projection to give us the perception of Argobast falling down the stairs. Usage of avant-garde cinematic techniques is something Hitchcock loved to experiment with (The CGI of Vertigo, unmistakenly, comes to mind).</p><h3 id=art-and-cinema>ART AND CINEMA</h3><p>A passing mention of the Bates house, an architecture inspired by Edward Hopper’s 1925 House by the Railroad, a chilling architectural equivalent representation of the occupant of the house. Hitchcock spent considerable efforts to craft a greatly detailed and almost impeccable mise-en-scene. It all adds up to the final effect that Psycho has on our psyche that is never left the same.</p><h3 id=hitchcock-and-voyeurism>HITCHCOCK AND VOYEURISM</h3><p>Another motif that deserves mention is Hitchcock’s fetish for voyeurism. Be it the camera scanning the skyline of Phoenix to narrow down into a hotel room where Marion and Loomis are having an illicit love affair. Or, Bates peeping into Cabin 1 through a hole in the wall (suggesting peeping into his customer’s lives is one of his pasttimes. Taxidermy being the “obvious” other) to find a half-naked Marion stripping, a beautiful creature I must give in to that and what arouses Bates desire and sets the plot in effective motion.</p><h3 id=an-avoidable-overkill>AN AVOIDABLE OVERKILL</h3><p>One tiny rant: I think the explanation at the climax by the psychatrist was an overkill and unnecessary. With a movie that relies so heavily on suspense and cliff-hangers, it would have only made more sense if Hitchcock had decided to let the audience connect the dots for themselves by just giving them enough morsel for thought. But it might have been Hitchcock paranoid about masses not being able to understand his film, a constant paranoid for artists, I suppose. Premise felt similar to Agatha Christie’s Mousetrap. And, the initial premise of Marion finally realizing her mistake of stealing money bore too great a resemblance to Selma Lagerlorf’s short story Rattrap, a text I remember from my school curriculum.</p><p>“We all go a little mad sometimes”. Yes, and Psycho confronts and celebrates that upfront and close.</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Blue Velvet | David Lynch | 1986</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Blue Velvet is an American thriller neo-noir. Set in a small town called Lumberton, we are introduced to a potentially unstable masochist singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) via the protagonist, Jeffrey, who has returned to town and has conveniently started romancing the local detective’s daughter (Laura Dern). With the romance of Jeffrey and Sandy forming a distracting side-plot, Lynch tells the story of Dorothy and Frank, “a very sick and dangerous man”, via, again, Jeffrey who is someone of a “mystery lover”, breaking into apartments and following criminals in the night. Frank has made a sexual slave out of Dorothy by blackmailing her about her kidnapped husband and son. Frank is killed. Dorothy returns back to sanity after uniting with her son and Jeffrey and Sandy are a thing.</p><p>Drawing obvious parallels between Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, I was better able to understand Lynch’s style, cinematography, and mind. Innocuous objects are lent a chilling dimension, common places (the stairway to Dorothy’s apartment, for example) are casted into mysterious and malicious environments, while characters hold central stage in stylization and dialogues as they enrapture the audience from the beginning. Of course, none of these contribute to the plot but manages to instantaneously heighten the suspense and drama of a scene, something Hitchcock would be extremely proud of. Blue Velvet has its share of absurdity and weirdness. For example; why the hell was that hooker dancing on top of the car while Jeffrey was being assaulted by Frank? The strong and lasting imageries that Lynch creates stems from his ability to appeal to the sensual and inherently absurd quality of the human mind. Sensuality, sexuality, the “primal instinct” (Remember Frank’s “I’ll fuck anything that moves”?), destruction, crime are such an important theme of the film. it is how Lynch views modern society, full of crime and lust - “a strange world”. Kudos to Isabelle R for incredible and bold portraiture of a disheveled mother and wife - a character of conflict herself when she cannot decide if she should report to the police or give in to her own pleasures that she draws from being slapped and beaten.</p><p>Mixed feelings about how I feel about this movie but in any case, it’s a must-watch. Masterpiece? I won’t go so far (That would be Mulholland Drive if anything). Managed to inspire Tarantino, Coen brothers, and the like. Influential. Yes, that.</p><p>“It’s a strange world” is a recurrent dialogue in the movie. It really is. I think the movie is Lynch’s expression of personal anguish of finding himself in a strange world and counting on the robins to arrive. Something we all can identify with, I suppose.</p><p>(first watch: 23rd September, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Loves of a Blonde | Milos Forman | 1965</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Loves of a Blonde is Forman’s concerns vocalised about an Eastern Czechoslovakia that is lagging behind its contemporary Western counterparts. He employs a number of elements to convey that apprehension. Being a jazz fan, he points out how Slovaks were still using traditional music in ballrooms whereas Beatlemania was raging in Western blocs (It was the 1960s, after all). He talks about the perception of sexual relations in contemporary Czechoslovak, consequent perception of woman, their doubts and concerns, outdated seduction practices. But at the same time, we see Andula, the heroine rebelling and making herself an active participant in her sexual lifestyle (supposedly a controversial idea at that time). We see her in an almost naked frontal shot, vivid and bright, like a fearless independent woman.</p><p>I like to think it was Forman silently talking about the next generation of Czechs waking up from their isolated worldviews to their Western counterparts and slowly coming to speed with the modern world. And of course, there is no dramatic plot or character transformation, although it is a feature. Overall, a gentle introduction to Czech cinema for me.</p><p>(first watch: 19th September, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Paterson | Jim Jarmusch | 2016</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>If I have to summarise this movie in one line: “The story of a modern man”. That may sound bland and simple but it isn’t. This movie follows a bus driver, Paterson (Adam driver) in the eponymous city of Paterson, New Jersey. He cuddles his wife in bed, wakes up at past 6, goes to work, takes his dog for a walk, hangs out in the bar. There doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with his life and then you realise that is exactly what is wrong with his life. He is a poet and writes in free-verse in his “secret notebook”. A girl calls him, “A bus driver that likes Emily Dickinson”. He rarely smiles or laughs and when he does, he’s careful to draw back. Maybe it’s difficulty to communicate with others, maybe it’s loneliness. he loves his wife, loves his job, likes to listen to people having conversations on the bus - draws inspiration from everything around him. He’s a poet, after all.</p><p>His wife has big dreams. Wants to be a country star, bakes cupcakes that are a hit at a local community and earns her $286. The small wins that accrue. Revels in the rich history and heritage of his city. It’s a movie that will make one think deeply about things. Or maybe not. But that’s not the point.</p><p>(first watch: 20th September, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Waking Life | Richard Linklater | 2001</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Waking Life is an introspective and rich movie commemorating and simultaneously examining human life and existence in general. There is no plot as such and nothing “progresses” in a conventional way. The protagonist is dreaming and talking to a number of people who are sermonizing him on a variety of topics, deep philosophical questions that loosely try to answer, “What are we?”. Linklater comments on linguistics, on morality, evolution, existentialism, the mind, politics, democracy (or lack thereof), of raw human emotions like hunger, anger, frustration, and what they lead to like murders, bombings, and war. There are two shots - one of a man who while talking to the protagonist on a sidewalk, sets himself on fire in broad daylight and another seemingly innocuous conversation between two pals in a bar which escalated into both shooting at each other. The pace of the movie is slow but it lends itself well to be watched at 1.5x or even 2x, just to keep one on their toes.</p><p>Linklater is known for creating immersive experiences out of human conversations (Before Sunset) and he does that here as well. Of course, it is futile to talk about this movie without talking about the unique visual style. I think it was a nice decision to animate the movie so as to allow that degree of freedom in more creatively expressing the dream-like premise in which the story unfolds. Kudos to the animator team. Loved those disorienting environment shifts, the floating buildings and trees. That had an enchanting effect on me personally.</p><p>My first impression was: Cool-ass movie where people ask deep philosophical questions. That still holds good.</p><p>(first watch: 17 September, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Vantage Point | Pete Travis | 2008</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>A refreshing new idea. So, the film is essentially a retelling of the story of the assassination of the POTUS at a peace summit in Spain through, you guessed it, multiple vantage points. Pete artfully divulges new information through these people’s perspective, kinda mimicking how no one agent in a system has complete information about an event but rather is distributed. This quality of an unreliable source of truth has often hastened critics to draw comparisons with Kurosawa’s Rashomon but I suppose that is too hasty and ill-founded. The Rashomon effect referred to the absence of confidence in the account of any narrator of an event. With a little thought, it can be seen that Vantage Point is not the same as the different vantage point only divulges more and coherent information about the truth that is generally agreed upon. It can be, interpreted as, an innovative mode of narration and sure, something that kept me engaged till the very end.</p><p>(first watch: 16 September, 2022)</p></div></details></li><li><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>My Sassy Girl | Jae-young Kwak | 2001</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><p>Based on the true story of a boy’s relationship that he wrote about on his blog, MSG was a phenomenal success in Korea when it was released.

In “Irreversible”, he undertakes the task of telling the story of an ugly and horrifying night in the life of a couple in reverse chronological order. We meet Marcus, wild and aggressive, who seems on the verge of a mental collapse, running across the city chasing someone by the name of Tenia. He’s the embodiment of aggression and violence: trashing, punching, smashing people’s heads. The frames captures raw emotions, a dillusioned Marcus as Noe tries to convey his world collapsing by swirling his camera all over the subject and beyond. The camera movement seems forced and annoying compelling us to empathise with the fact that all is not well in Marcus’s life and suddenly, the movements start to feel like poetic. The only point of calmness is his friend, Pierre, who accompanies him through the cacophonic night.</p><p>Marcus’ girlfriend, Alex, was raped and killed in the subway while Marcus and Pierre were at a party. Alex was fed up by a drunken Marcus and left for home alone. She was suggested to take the subway to cross the road as it was “safer”. The shocking and terrifying 9 minute long rape scene shook the Cannes audience way back in 2002. And yet, it is so enraging and horrifying to realise that this is how it happens when it does.</p><p>The movie takes a peaceful turn in the second half as Gaspar elucidates the relationship between Alex and Marcus. Their bedroom scene is so pregnant with irony; when Alex vehemantly disagrees to be treated like an object men can pass around; or when she smirks at Pierre, her ex, when asked about her sex life with Marcus. The smirk of a woman who prides herself in the secrets she keeps. Something broke in my heart when she said, “It’s always the woman who decides”. It is a well-written balance to the first half where Marcus rummages through the wastelands of Paris, through filthy sex clubs, through depraved souls, and through smashing skulls.</p><p>Gaspar Noe learnt everything in film school just to make sure he never uses them. I talked about the camera, floating in space like a spectre. There is a loud wailing noise in the background at all times. The color palatte is dark. We see subjects in glimpses.</p><p>PS: Heavy violence, gore, sexual content. Highly disturbing (like all Noe movies).
