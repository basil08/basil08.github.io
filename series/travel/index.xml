It shouldn’t be this hard to write a travelogue, right? RIGHT?! But it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some part of that blame goes to all the rich and many, many experiences that I have had on this trip. Each of them fought for space in this post, and inadvertently, I had to let go of some. In any case, what follows is my travelogue for my trip to London from 16th August to 27th August 2024 - reproduced to the best of my abilities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stories from the Underground: Part 2</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/stories-from-the-underground-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 20:50:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/stories-from-the-underground-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>As promised, this is part 2 of &lt;a href="https://basil08.github.io/post/stories-from-the-underground-part-1/">Stories from the Underground&lt;/a>, my travelogue on the GCP workshop at Oxford and beyond.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="day-3-21st-december">Day 3 (21st December)&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I woke up and stretched like a cat on my double bed. Having a room for two all for myself was a welcome change from long hours of sitting and waiting around at airports. I glanced at my clock, 6ish. &lt;em>Perfect&lt;/em>, I thought. Wrapped up some BSP work, made one of those instant hot chocolate thingie and went for my walk — a considerably longer one because the workshop was over and we were scheduled to depart for Oxford at 10. Video called my folks. I forced myself to take unchartered paths through the woods. It was fascinating to observe a biome so biologically different from one back in the tropics – mosses and lichens were aplenty and so were ferns and temperate-ish flora. The wetness had turned the dirt into mud and my shoes were making squishy noises all along the way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stories from the Underground: Part 1</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/stories-from-the-underground-part-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 09:50:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/stories-from-the-underground-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Disclaimer: This post might contain expletives.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="prologue">Prologue&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I am waiting at the airport bound to New Delhi right now on NYE. It&amp;rsquo;s been around 10 days since I came back from my first international trip and subsequently go on to represent my institute at Inter IIT Cultural Meet at IIT Kharagpur. I have classes from 8 am tomorrow morning. When did my life got so fast?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What is this life if, full of care,&lt;br>
We have no time to stand and stare. &lt;br>

&lt;p>This travelogue was created based on my journal entries on a daily(ish) basis. I volunteered as a teacher at a remote village in Uttarakhand and helped high school kids prepare for competitive exams (JEE/NEET) for two weeks. This travelogue is presented almost in its entirety with few redacts that I deemed too personal.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="day-1-3031-may">Day 1 (30/31 May)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I got onto an almost full Traveller van in front of Satpura&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup> amidst torrential rain and found myself greeted with unknown (and somewhat hostile) faces. I got into a corner and crumpled myself somehow into that little space. And we rolled around 7:30pm. After sometime I realised, to my horror, that I wanted to puke. It was then that it dawned on me that perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m also one of those people who cannot stand travelling in cars although I was surprised because it had never happened before (also maybe because I have never been on a trip like this). Anyhow, because of a sheer stroke of good luck, someone shifted and I got a window seat and I got better because of the cool Delhi air.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BUIDL: Hitching a ride on the web3 wagon</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/buidl-hitching-a-ride-on-the-web3-wagon/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2022 09:28:14 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/buidl-hitching-a-ride-on-the-web3-wagon/</guid><description>&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://basil08.github.io/img/ethindia22/18.jpeg"

 &lt;/blockquote>
 &lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The Ethereum ecosystem, particularly the scaling L2 solutions are witnessing dramatic progress in terms of breakthroughs and innovation. The &lt;code>Infinite Garden&lt;/code> is the phrase used to refer to the truly decentralized techno-haven where interaction between online entities are transparent and uncensored. Free from censorship, state control, fraud, and malicious agents, powered by the ecosystem of applications built on blockchains - in short, an information utopia. Personally, the idea seems enticing and inviting. But transitioning from web2 to web3 is a long way and the vision I outlined, although the shared vision of the people on the frontier of this revolution, is still a long, long way into the future.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
