It&rsquo;s related to English &ldquo;rationality&rdquo; and &ldquo;arithmetic&rdquo;, but also &ldquo;art&rdquo; and &ldquo;harmony&rdquo;. And &ldquo;right&rdquo;, both in the senses of &ldquo;natural rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;the right answer&rdquo;. And &ldquo;order&rdquo;. And &ldquo;arete&rdquo; and &ldquo;aristos&rdquo; and all those other Greek words about morality. And &ldquo;artificial&rdquo;, as in eg artificial intelligence. More speculatively &ldquo;reign&rdquo; and related words about rulership, and &ldquo;rich&rdquo; and related words about money.
<cite>– Astral Codex Ten&rsquo;s about</cite></p></blockquote><h2 id=who-am-i>Who am I?</h2><p>Hi there! My name is Basil Labib and I&rsquo;m a sophomore at <a href=https://home.iitd.ac.in>IIT Delhi</a>.</p><h2 id=brief-intro>Brief Intro</h2><p>I&rsquo;m interested in STEM. I like films and art history. I love to read. I jokingly began describing myself as a cross between an autodidactic polymath and a Romantic. And that&rsquo;s a good working definition.</p><p>This blog is an attempt to make learning rewarding for others. It is also partly my scratchpad to note thoughts and ideas.</p><details><summary style=display:block;cursor:pointer;color:#00b;text-decoration:underline;padding:10px;transition:.3s;user-select:none>Not so brief introduction</summary><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;overflow:auto;height:100%;user-select:none;padding:0 20px;line-height:1.5"><h2 id=enterpreneurship-and-finance>Enterpreneurship and Finance</h2><p>I love to try to understand complex systems such as automatons and economics cycles. Economics is interesting because 1) it affects everybody 2) it is the intersection of psychology, chaos, mathematics, CS, and politics. Always up for learning queer financial lingo and economic theories. Simulating discussions on consumerism, product-market fit, interest rates and the like are welcome. I am interested in enterpreneurship which is a multidisciplinary profession. I&rsquo;m generous and patient. So, if you have an interesting idea to develop, I&rsquo;ll be happy to listen.</p><h2 id=tech-and-computer>Tech and Computer</h2><p>I started quite late with computers relative to my generation. But I instantly felt in love with it. I devoured the entire Java programming language in 9th grade. I wanted to learn everything about how computers worked, right down to the silicon. I&rsquo;m glad that enthusiasm has only appreciated over time.</p><p>I am proficient in full stack / app development, participate in open source, freelance occasionally and volunteer at <a href=https://cato.tv>catotv</a>, an edtech organisation, which focuses on alternative pedagogical techniques. I like to think about general AI and design narrow AI solutions for tasks like game playing. Oh, I play chess too. Planning to learn go.</p><h2 id=design>Design</h2><p>Another cornerstone in a human life is the appreciation of design. They are another class of people who I have immense respect for. Design as a discipline is the first and the last step in engineering. A good engineer must be a good designer first.</p><h2 id=reading>Reading</h2><p>As I said, I read a lot of books / magazines and so on. I keep a log of <a href=/bookshelf>my readings</a> here. I also record book summaries and thought processes on the blog. I like writing (as should be evident) and almost started a youth magazine in high school. I balance between non-fictions and fictions but good fiction is always welcome.</p><h2 id=listening>Listening</h2><p>I appreciate everything from Baroque symphonies to Green Day. My go-to genre would be rock though I strongly suspect this will change soon. Dvorak, Tchaikovsky, Mahler, Brahms (though not fully). Beatles (of course), Led Zeppelin, Radiohead, Beach House, U2, and all these great modern artists. Planning to explore Jazz and Blues in the future. I play guitar.</p><h2 id=art-and-culture>Art and Culture</h2><p>I am interested in a holistic understanding of varied cultures and linguistics. If I look at a way people do a certain thing, I like to find out how that came about. I like history from an investigative perspective and by extension, I read a lot of autobiographies and memoirs. Though I&rsquo;m not an expert on the subject (but I&rsquo;m striving to be), I love art. I am learning German currently.</p><h2 id=philosophy>Philosophy</h2><p>My outlook to philosophy is purely practical. I hate people who don&rsquo;t know what they are talking about. Nietzsche believed that philosophy is &ldquo;not a critique of words by means of other words&rdquo; and I cannot agree more. To me, philosophy is the pursuit of answers to these two questions: &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How do I conduct myself in this life?&rdquo; Unfortunately, something not most of us are taught or taught to think as important. I&rsquo;m a first principle thinker and always trust the source rather than the derivatives.</p><div style=display:flex><div style=background-color:#d1cfcf;padding:5px;border-radius:4px;margin:.2em><blockquote>&ldquo;There are heights of the soul from which even tragedy ceases to look tragic.&rdquo;
– Friedrich Nietzsche, <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em></blockquote></div></div></div></details><h2 id=contact-me>Contact me</h2><p>Have a suggestion, idea or just wanna talk?
