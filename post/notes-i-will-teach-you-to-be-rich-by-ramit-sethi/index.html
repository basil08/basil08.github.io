<span class="f6 gray">June 15, 2021</span>
<article itemprop=articleBody id=content class="w-90 lh-copy">
<p>Sethi&rsquo;s book, at it&rsquo;s core, is a set of rules and tricks that can be applied by an aware and motivated individual to ensure a life of abundance relative to their current financial standings. Motivated to become rich himself (and hailing from India) at a young age, Sethi learnt from his blunders and noted his successes. He started blogging about his wins which eventually evolved into this book. Needless to say, his advice are well-researched, practical and tested. Do they work? It seems to.</p>
<p>This is my attempt to summarize the essential ideas presented in the book which is bore out of personal necessity as I am sure I will forget half of them (Speaking from past experience) in due course and will procrastinate till the universe cools down to open the book and reread it. Ergo.</p>
<p>Two caveats before we begin:</p>
<ol>
<li>The book is dated. Use it as guiding rather than definitive. Research is key. Use the rather scant Terms section to look up artificially confusing financial terms.</li>
<li>The book is centered on the average American citizen. Find appropriate / equivalent schemes for your country of residence.</li>
</ol>
<p>How to get rich in one line: Clear all debts. Choose the right accounts. Spend consciously. Automate money flow. Invest early and aggressively. Improvise and take action.</p>
<h2 id=rich-or-sexy>Rich or Sexy?</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Getting started</strong> is more important than becoming an expert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ordinary actions get ordinary results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do you want to be rich? (Hint: Because it sucks being poor).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=credit-cards>Credit Cards</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Two components: credit report and credit / CIBIL / FICO score.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay your credit bills on time.</strong> It&rsquo;s free short-term loan. Get a no-fee card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rewards are important. Two or three cards are fine. Keep them active for long. Get more credit. Offers excellent consumer protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small wins waste time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Debt: Pay off the highest interest-incurring cards first. Negotiate lower APR. Setup aggressive automatic transfers to pay off.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=bank-accounts>Bank Accounts</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Online savings account (NIYO, RazorPayX, Open) > Traditional savings account > Traditional current / checking account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Savings account: save up for longer-term goals. Less transactions. Current account: for frequent withdrawals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credit Unions: like local banks, not-for-profit, owned by customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Downside online savings acc: Few days for transactions to clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to rep. Effective and important.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=setup-investing>Setup investing</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open up 401(k), Roth IRA and an investment account with a discount brokerage firm (Or whatever is your equivalent in your country).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setup automatic payments. Match 100% with your employee on 401(k). Go to Roth, then come back to 401 if still left.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=spending>Spending</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Allocate spending money in <em>&ldquo;buckets&rdquo;</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rule of thumb: 60% expenses, 10-20% investing, 10% savings (or debt), 10% leisure (or debt).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just save - Save for a goal. Track spending weekly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increase revenue flow</strong>: Invest aggressively in yourself (health, education). Negotiate raise. Switch to higher-paying job. Do freelancing.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id=investing>Investing</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Financial magazines, pundits, portfolio managers, advisers are nuisance. Cannot predict market 75% of the time. <strong>Manage yourself.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preference: (Lifecycle funds) > Index funds > Mutual funds > Stocks, bonds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Major predictor of portfolio volatility: <em>your mix of stocks and bonds</em>. <strong>Your investment plan is more important than your actual investments.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Index funds: low-management fee (expense ratio). Rebalance allocation every 12-18 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asset allocation: Check Swensen model</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>W. Buffett - &ldquo;Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful&rdquo;. That is, &ldquo;Buy low, sell high&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignore the noise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=terms>Terms</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>credit score / CIBIL / FICO - number between 300 and 850; represents credit risk to lender; higher is better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>APR - Annual Percentage Rate. Interest rate to credit card companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credit utilization rate - how much you owe divided by your available credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life cycle funds or Target date retirement funds - &ldquo;funds of funds&rdquo;. managed. assets allocated based only on your age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stocks: Large-cap, Mid-cap, Small, cap, International, Growth, Value. Bonds: Government, Corporate, Short term, Long term, Municipal, Inflation-protected (TIPS). REITs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REITs - Real Estate Investment Trust. Different than stocks or bonds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=downsides>Downsides</h2>
<p>Okay, this might be a personal rant but the language of the book could have been more terse. This may be a demand my brain concocted from reading classics but formal language never hurts. Foregoing first-person addressing, frequent (and sometimes, redundant) jokes might have helped deliver the ideas in a more concise book thereby boosting the number of prospective readers who otherwise will shy away simply at the page count. As Cicero said, &ldquo;When you wish to instruct, be brief&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, I would have been better off reading a classic.</p>
<h2 id=financial-blogs>Financial blogs</h2>
<ol>
