lh-copy"><p>Reflections on a personal incident that happened a few days back. Due to the nature and peculiarity of the event, I was terrified and confused whether I should publish it or not, hence I have decided to do so.</p><h1 id=what-happened>What Happened</h1><p>I was added to a Whatsapp group of current and past IITD graduates with the title “General Elections 2024” couple of days before June 4 (the day when the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections results were announced). The purpose of the group was to discuss matters of political and national importance including but not limited to policy efficacy, government criticism, and so on. I knew some people in the group who were my seniors but not everyone. The group gradually grew to a strength of around 100 people.</p><p>On June 16th, one of the members of the group, let’s call them X made a few disturbing remarks on the atrocities being inflicted on the Palestinian civilians of Gaza. I was aware from past messages that X was a far right person politically and such remarks are <a href=https://x.com/JaipurDialogues/status/1710650369871896840>common in such circles</a>. See below.</p><figure><img src=/img/jailed/5.png></figure><p>Since I have been gradually educating myself on the topic of the Israel-Palestine conflict, I felt that X’s remarks were based on misinformation and decided to counter it.</p><p>I spent the next hour or so engaged in a verbal debate with X which progressively stopped being a debate due to the depreciating intelligence of the opposition. In a geopolitic debate which would have solely been based on facts and global events, I found myself staring at X’s CBSE English scorecard because they felt that sharing it in the group would establish their debating acumen. I was also offered their history scorecard in order to establish their command over world history (Historians and history scholars are scared after the far right have started using CBSE scoresheet as a way to justify their views).</p><figure><img src=/img/jailed/6.png alt="Me: You have never studied [Palestinian] history. X: Should I send my history marks?"><figcaption><p>Me: You have never studied [Palestinian] history. X: Should I send my history marks?</p></figcaption></figure><p>Funnily, NCERT doesn’t cover Israel-Palestine conflict or even any Middle Eastern history in its curriculum. I was dumbstruck as I couldn’t find any logical response to this petty move of sending report cards to a group full of IITians to justify intellectual supremacy. We have collectively failed as a nation to nurture emotional intelligence.</p><p>My main point was about the casualties of innocent Palestinian civilians (most of them are women and <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/C79PY3QvsIV/>children</a>) and how Israel is <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20240213200043/https://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/20240108_israel_is_starving_gaza>systematically starving them to death</a>. I equally condemn both Israel and Hamas in their terror activities and do not support terror of any kind whatsoever. But I find it extremely disturbing how a group of Indians justify civilian killings without proper context.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/jailed/3.png></figure><a href=https://thewire.in/government/govt-owned-munitions-india-ltd-exported-ordnance-to-israel-as-gaza-was-reduced-to-rubble>Context</a> for my message.</p><p>This group is quick to label any dissenting voice as “terrorist sympathiser” or worse even “terrorist” as if the words have become fashionable to identify anyone with a differing viewpoint. I felt traumatised when I was labelled a terrorist sympathiser by a person with such lowly intelligence as highlighted above. I will reassert myself again: I am a proud Indian and I pledge my allegiance to uphold the integrity of my Constitution. I am an IITian and I plan to pledge my life for the prosperity of my nation. And I feel deeply for any injustice meted out to any innocent group in India or the world.</p><h2 id=are-rights-not-meaningful-anymore>Are Rights Not Meaningful Anymore?</h2><p>But one must ask why I have to reiterate my rightful claim to my motherland. Why this sudden alienation to rights that I am an implicit enjoyer of since my birth? One must step into the shoes of an Indian Muslim and understand his helplessness and misery as he must put up with videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7esf2i5XgBU">policemen kicking Muslims bowing down in prayer</a> to a fresh new <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8bqcD0ve6Y/?img_index=1">lynching video</a> of a poor Muslim by religious bigots almost daily. As an Indian Muslim, I feel <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/C8Y9cQ3Mqu7/>psychologically traumatised</a> and terrified as I question where are the rights that my motherland has granted me?</p><p>After the person understood that they won’t be able to “have the last word” as I was more informed than them on the matter, they targeted my religion.</p><figure><img src=/img/jailed/0.png alt="The emoji is Kaa&amp;rsquo;bah, the most sacred Islamic structure in the world."><figcaption><p>The emoji is Kaa&rsquo;bah, the most sacred Islamic structure in the world.</p></figcaption></figure><p>And when the entire group condemned them for this utterly depraved behaviour towards a junior, they tried to inadequately cover up as follows:</p><figure><img src=/img/jailed/1.png></figure><p>The group admin kicked X out of the group and we thought that was the end of it.</p><h2 id=the-allegations>The Allegations</h2><p>I was lazing around after offering my Eid prayers the next day when I receive the following DM from X,</p><hr><p>Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding Unsolicited Sympathies and Support for Terrorism in Palestine</p><p>Dear Basil,</p><p>I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to formally address a grave concern regarding your recent unsolicited expressions of sympathy and support towards terrorism in Palestine, as communicated in our official group conversations. These actions are alarming and pose significant concerns regarding national security.</p><p>It is imperative to understand the gravity of supporting or expressing sympathy towards terrorism, which is not only against the law but also undermines the safety and security of our nation. Your behavior is not only inappropriate but also potentially dangerous, given the sensitive nature of the subject matter.</p><p>In light of the seriousness of this issue, I have lodged a formal complaint with the National Investigation Agency, the local police authorities, and the Director of IIT Delhi. I have attached all relevant official group conversations as evidence to support my complaint.</p><p>Given the potential national security implications, I urge you to respond promptly and professionally to any inquiries or requests for information from the investigating authorities. This matter cannot be taken lightly, and your cooperation will be crucial in resolving this issue appropriately.</p><p>Please consider this letter as an urgent call to reflect on your actions and understand the severe consequences they could entail. Your prompt attention and adherence to this matter are expected.</p><p>Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>X</p><hr><p>Along with a <a href=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/iit-bombay-students-accuse-professor-guest-speaker-for-supporting-palestinian-terrorist-2461393-2023-11-10>link to a post by India Today</a> with the text &ldquo;For reference&rdquo;.</p><p>Yes! <em>I was being implicated as a terrorist sympathiser</em>, by the person who had single-mindedly praised and chest thumped about the killing of innocent humans. I felt betrayed at that moment. What did the “For reference” stand for? Did it mean that X was showing me what would happen to me if I don&rsquo;t agree to their views? No, in their eyes, it had stopped being a possibility altogether and turned into a prerogative.</p><p>I made up my mind to fight it even if it meant horrible consequences. I had to. It is my birthright and I felt I had done nothing wrong, least of all tried to put points in perspective. I phoned a bunch of seniors who helped me take care of the situation and it died down eventually.</p><p>Let’s take a step back and try to analyse what happened. X could not tolerate being bested by me in a perfectly sound debate on a geopolitical issue. The best retort was to illegally and inappropriately frame me as a terrorism sympathiser so as to put mental and psychological pressure on me and to accept his point of view. X is a pass out and I’m interning this summer meaning very well that I do not have the financial means to go on a legal battle.</p><h2 id=the-fabric-of-our-nation>The Fabric Of Our Nation</h2><p>This must ring an alarm in the mind of those who still care about the high ideals on which the identity of our nation is founded, not on bigoted religious fervour. The ideals allow for free and unrestrained dialogue and respect and dignity to disciplined and structured conversations. The moment such guarantees are maligned by fanatics like X, we must be warned that the very fabric of our nation is in danger.</p><p>What I wonder is: if I had taken his comment on my religion seriously and tried to escalate the matter by complaining to some higher authority, would I have received the same level of attention?</p><h2 id=the-ideological-makeup-of-an-andhbhakt>The ideological makeup of an andhbhakt</h2><p>I spent some time trying to characterise X and their behaviour. I have observed them for a longer time before this episode and have noted their views on various other issues. I think the following are extremely dangerous characters in any human being which promotes instability, strife, and violence.</p><figure><img src=/img/jailed/2.png></figure><ol><li>Zero humility and horribly egotistical - There was not a single conversation when X accepted that they might be wrong. In their eyes, they are <em>always</em> right which is humanly impossible.</li><li>Outright rejection of facts - X belongs to a class of people who will accept facts only if it supports their point of view, else just refuse to accept facts. This is unscientific and in contrast to the scientific temperament. I laugh at all of X’s scorecards that they shared.</li></ol><p><figure><img src=/img/jailed/4.png></figure><em>The first message is by X. The second is by another member of the group. Translation: X: I won’t imagine even quoting facts (to support my views). I will dismiss them. The person: Who can dismiss facts? One can dismiss opinions. Go and learn debating and conversation 101 before becoming a keyboard warrior.</em></p><ol start=3><li>Resort to (direct or indirect) intimidation to crush opposing views - The fact that X implicated a junior student as a “terrorist sympathiser” and complained to NIA is evidence of their audacity and focus on using intimidation and state machinery for false allegations.</li><li>Utterly selfish with no regards for others - Almost everyone in the group was in support of the government’s active duty to provide basic healthcare and education to poverty-stricken Indians except X.</li><li>(Likely but unconfirmed) Possible maniac, psychopath, and a sadist - Based on limited digital interaction with one individual, hope to collect more data by engaging with more such individuals.</li></ol><h2 id=looking-ahead>Looking Ahead</h2><p>The wave of Hindu nationalism is a <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/C8Y9cQ3Mqu7/>vicious and horrible political trend</a>. Nationalism alienates other groups and creates social instability which is never conducive for economic growth. Supporters of neoliberalism may be satiated to live in utmost comfort and luxury and ignore the blinding inequality and other social demons that plague our society. But as Gurcharan Das remarks in <em>India Unbound</em>, India is a “wise elephant” and not a “tiger”. It moves slowly but it moves with an assurance and gravitas. Historically, India has accommodated the plights and concerns of everyone and so it will be. Those who think they can gain popularity by playing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8bqcD0ve6Y/?img_index=1">divisive ideologies</a> are horribly mistaken.</p><div style="border-top:1px solid gray;border-bottom:1px solid gray;padding:1rem;padding-top:0"><div><p><span style=font-size:larger;font-weight:700>Basil</span>
