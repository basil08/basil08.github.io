Design of a system happens before building not after.

<p>Design. An idea which I admit rather shamefully to not have paid any serious attention to (until now).</p>
<p>Design of a system happens before building not after.</p>
<p>This, it seems, is a general attitude towards design by builders and engineers or people who work on the guts or so called backend of a system as was coyly pointed out by the author himself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is true. Design is something I have always thought of as an after thought in my projects at least uptil now. But no more!</p>
<p>The more I dwelled into David Kadavy&rsquo;s excellent book on Design, I began to appreciate design at a much, much deeper level. This book is exactly what it says on the tin and I like it for how it tries to make a seemingly abstract idea like design accessible in a concrete manner to a &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; (ie one who is functionality minded) by employing lots of examples.</p>
<p>Kadavy took care to pick out real world good design examples and explain what makes them good. He points out the underlying design principles that generally governs the interface of a design. Seriously though, how on Earth would I have expected to understand why Manet&rsquo;s ‚ÄúLuncheon on the Garden‚Äù was the beginning of Impressionism or what makes Seurat&rsquo;s ‚ÄúA Sunday afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jatte‚Äù a captivating painting?!</p>

<h2 id=how-did-i-get-hold-of-this-book>How did I get hold of this book?</h2>
<p>Ok, this is another one of my web rabbit hole expedition. I was reading <a href=http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html>ESR&rsquo;s jargon files</a> where he references a <a href=https://letsgolarval.wordpress.com/>blog</a> by an anon CS student for Linux newbies. Did I need any restraint? Off I went through most of her posts (which were fun and properly written) and found this book in one of her currently readings from perhaps 2016(!). She isn&rsquo;t active as of today. Last post is dated ~2018. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I enjoyed her writings to be honest.</p>
<h2 id=design-is-not-definitive>Design is not definitive</h2>
<p>Of course, these principles are not set in stone as the subject it deals with is inherently a creative discipline. However, the ideas presented are a general guide for the uninitiated and they seem to be present in almost all good designs so I conclude they must be good heuristics. For eg: the idea of dominance, or direction, composition etc.</p>
<p>The point is design is not something one gains by reading a book. It is not a place where you can reach and exclaim to others ‚ÄúI have arrived!‚Äù</p>
<p>You can read a <a href=/post/notes-design-for-hackers-by-david-kadavy>book summary I prepared</a> for more or better yet read the book (which I highly recommend) if you tinker with stuff.</p>
<h2 id=what-next>What next?</h2>
<p>I would love to go to art exhibitions and develop a taste for art as I can now appreciate the ideas latent therein with more fervour.</p>
