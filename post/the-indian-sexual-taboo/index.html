It is indeed shameful and comical to know that the judiciary is confused as to the definition of &ldquo;pornography&rdquo; and &ldquo;obscene&rdquo; and specific laws under which to prosecute Kundra and Co.</p><h2 id=why-do-porn-industries-flourish>Why do porn industries flourish?</h2><p>Leaving prosecution and dissemination of judgement to more able individuals than me, I would like to raise few points about the other side of the coin: <em>The Indian porn consumer base</em>. If Raj Kundra was able to lure financially compromised girls into creating obscene content and sell them for millions, then why did he succeed? <strong>Markets thrive where there is demand</strong> - indeed, the fundamental basis of capitalism. Pornhub yearly statistics reveal Indian consumers on the site has been on a consistent rise. And that is just one provider.</p><h2 id=to-kama-sutra-or-not-to-kama-sutra>To Kama Sutra or not to Kama Sutra&mldr;</h2><p>Try initiating a conversation on sex (or anything that has even a distant sexual connotation) with your parents and expect varying degrees of indifference, loathe or repulsion. Isn&rsquo;t this a glaring contradiction at the very heart of Indian ideals? <strong>What kind of society are we that fail to show the maturity to acknowledge our identity yet feel tempted to privately watch strangers in sexual acts?</strong>
What kind of precedence are we setting for posterity? What kind of environment that stifles conversation about an aspect of human life that&rsquo;s as important as food or housing? Most people will shrug at these questions because they&rsquo;re not &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; and doesn&rsquo;t comply with their mental model of the world (Don&rsquo;t just nod along, it&rsquo;s very difficult to assess one&rsquo;s own self).</p><h2 id=all-the-damage-we-dont-see>All the damage we don&rsquo;t see</h2><p>Our culture has encouraged us being tight lipped about our own sexual pleasures and desires. That has led to grown-up adults believing it is safer to consume obscenity in the privacy of our rooms than to garner social disapproval by acknowledging them. What we don&rsquo;t see, in our myopic decision, is the larger, grimmer reality behind our insecurity. A base like India creates immense demand in the industry and we don&rsquo;t turn to think for once the trafficking rackets and porn industries that we are feeding. Videos are virtually indestructible. What about the dignity of those girls? <strong>What we don&rsquo;t see is the hundreds of Kundras operating today stashing cash in their foreign bank accounts, feeding on our desires and the helplessness of those girls</strong>. What we see is the bluish screen, the comfortable privacy and a pack of tissue nearby. And that to me is outright cowardice.</p><h2 id=can-we-do-anything>Can we do anything?</h2><p>Markets are fed by scarcity of resources. Sex sells because people are unwilling to talk about it. To borrow from the 1998 Pepsi commercial, <em>ye dil maange more</em>.</p><p>I can seriously go on and on about the destructive and depraved nature of porn. Creating fantastical expectations from real sex and women. Patronising women. Creating unrealistic mental images for what a woman is like. One of the reasons of rising crime rates against women. You get the point. It&rsquo;s a keystone demon in society. I strongly believe that once we <strong>de-stigmatise sex in the Indian mind</strong> (Not an easy task), people will turn away from these nefarious services and reach out to real people in the real world with a sound understanding of responsibilities and expectations involved.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>All that being said, outlook of people are changing and that is a positive sign. We need more forums to voice such questions and <strong>enable more individuals to ponder about their rights, sexual and otherwise</strong>. And I hope the court can come to a sensible conclusion and hammer down sharply on Mr. Kundra for his lowlife ventures.</p><div style="border-top:1px solid gray;border-bottom:1px solid gray;padding:1rem;padding-top:0"><div><p><span style=font-size:larger;font-weight:700>Basil</span>
