there are certain things that are introduced to us as lore. Too pristine and novel to question. My whiff with Radiohead was similar. Everybody seemed to be mesmerised by this band given all sorts of superlative monikers.

This question left a lasting impression on Yorke and later inspired him to pen <em>&ldquo;Subterranean Homesick Alien&rdquo;</em>, a jewel of <em>OK Computer</em>, Radiohead&rsquo;s third studio album and hailed as one of the greatest rock albums ever made. It is not sure when Radiohead assumed mythical status in the music world but the world of RH is replete with such trivia and anecdotes that seems to bring us closer to // the only band that made sense //.</p><p>It is neither possible nor fitting to cover RH&rsquo;s entire discography in one post so I have decided to uncover the secrets of their groundbreaking 1997 album <em>OK Computer</em>. This approach has its deficencies, most notably, the inability to examine and put into context RH&rsquo;s works in a larger spectrum and to be unable to comment on their development in the longer run but it also gives us the luxury to dwelve deeper into their works.</p><h2 id=introduction--who-were-the-radioheads>Introduction / Who were the Radioheads?</h2><p>Radiohead was the 90s expression of the emerging swatches of neoliberalism. RH managed to achieve its distinct anti-consumerism, anti-capitalist style through an era of continuous reinvention and rediscovery. They made sure to discard the bad things, groom the good ones. Take <em>Pablo Honey</em> for example, nothing more than a pretentious mix of goth and rock lines, with occassional moments of genius but rather boring as a whole. But by 1995 and the introduction of <em>The Bends</em>, RH has discovered its ability to sway music lines; with the combined talent pool of Yorke, Greenwood, and Selway it realised its ability to create music melodies that left a tinging impression on the listener. <em>OK Computer</em> and <em>Kid A</em> made us aware of a genius in the rock community; the new protege. Parallels were drawn with <em>Pink Floyd</em>, <em>U2</em>, <em>Blur</em> but really Radiohead are simply, Radiohead. Their fusion of art and politics took a while to mature and develop a unique character. But whenever RH created noises // spoke // emerged //, it make sure to do that with a reckoning force and a clear redefinition of rock as a genre.</p><p>What are the themes of OK Computer? The album cover features a sprawling highway. The nose of an aeroplane. The first song is named <em>Airbag</em>. The opening lines of <em>Let Down</em> goes:</p><blockquote><p><em>Transport</em><br><em>Motorways and tramlines</em><br><em>Starting and then stopping</em><br><em>Taking off and landing</em></p></blockquote><p>Yes, we are talking about cars and airplanes, no doubt a triumph of humanity, a technological feat but also a symbol of captivity as we volunteer to be imprisoned in tin cans on wheels. Although there is an obvious dissent about negligent environmental concerns, a deeper interpretation goes along the lines of technological forest and how humanity is lost in it. The lines <em>Starting and then stopping</em> invokes images of a machine in which people are stuck, a clockwork universe, with a routine for people talking, people laughing, people onboarding cars and airplanes.</p><p><em>Airbag</em> has the following lines:</p><blockquote><p><em>In a fast German car</em><br><em>I&rsquo;m amazed that I survived</em><br><em>An airbag saved my life</em></p></blockquote><p>The <em>fast German car</em> tells us that it&rsquo;s a connected globalised economy. The car crash image is a motif that Yorke uses again and again in his songs. It stems from his own fear of car accidents. The driver&rsquo;s life is saved after a fatal, near-death experience. He is obviously traumatised but he has survived.</p><blockquote><p><em>In an interstellar burst</em><br><em>I&rsquo;m back to save the universe</em></p></blockquote><p>is a recovered driver who now feels invincible. He feels like</p><h4 id=fitter-happier>Fitter Happier</h4><p>There is something fundamentally unsettling about &ldquo;Fitter Happier&rdquo;. The first song on the B side of OK Computer, it is, by style, a &ldquo;Musique concrete&rdquo; - a composition that uses recorded sounds as raw material. There is <em>no</em> music per se. A tour de force of artistic expression, the singer is Fred, the sound synthesizer program on Apple 2 computer who is saying the lines rather than singing. The lyric is devoid of meters or rhyming. The lyrics seem like something written by a robot lyricist. What I like about Fitter Happier is the point of perspective. The lyric is almost like a set of directives. It is what everyone wants to do/be, knows they should be doing it, but somehow are unable to and that is disappointing and depressing. Thom wrote the lyrics for the piece after a writer&rsquo;s block which is evident from the sheer raw creative shown by this masterful and thought-provoking song.</p><blockquote><p><em>(No killing moths or putting boiling water on ants)</em></p></blockquote><p>Only someone who is disturbed within would want to hurt other living beings. The singer is trying to remind himself of not hurting others, the moth and ants are euphemism, of course, for humans. But including moths and ants makes it more potent because these insects are, by nature, vulnerable to humans so it is the human&rsquo;s sole discretion that determines the fate of these insects which is not the case when a human tries to harm another - the other person can defend themself. Moreover, what can we say about a person who pours boiling water on ants. It&rsquo;s just a ghastly, cruel image. Imagery, yes. Imagery is used in a masterful way by Yorke to paint a greatly introspective image of the modern worker in a corporate world. This song is pure art.</p><h4 id=no-surprises>No Surprises</h4><h4 id=subterranean-homesick-alien>Subterranean Homesick Alien</h4><p>The band&rsquo;s work output is rangeful. Phenomenal .

tain essay question he was assigned: “If you were an alien landing on
Earth, how would you describe what you saw?” Thom found this
question not just mind-blowing but also kind of funny; he could well
imagine the huge laugh an alien would have when faced with the
strange phenomenon of life on Earth. While we may never know what
Thom actually wrote in response to that question, it would prompt
him to pen a song many years later called “Subterranean Homesick
Alien.”</p><hr><p>Karma police</p><p>Arrest this man</p><p>He talks in maths.</p><p>He buzzes like a fridge,</p><p>He’s like a detuned radio…</p><p>-Karma police, Radiohead</p><hr><p>I’ll let this quote from their Spotify bio page say the rest.</p><p>“At some point in the early 21st century, Radiohead became something more than a band: they became a touchstone for everything that is fearless and adventurous in rock.”</p><hr><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/radiohead/comments/ovvkrg/understanding_ok_computers_fitter_happier/>https://www.reddit.com/r/radiohead/comments/ovvkrg/understanding_ok_computers_fitter_happier/</a></p><p>Fitter Happier is a ‘Musique Concrete’ song, which means it&rsquo;s a composition that utilizes recorded sounds as raw material. It is a song that is modified through audio effects and tape manipulation to sound rustic or strange on purpose. Thom Yorke wrote the lyrics after a writer’s block and himself describes the song as a checklist of slogans for the 1990s. The lyrics are spoken from a Macintosh SimpleText application by the synthesised voice Fred, which Thom described as “the most emotional voice he heard in ages.” It’s ironic that the voice for this song about anti-consumerist attitude comes from a Macintosh considering the symbol of late stage capitalism Apple has now become.</p><p>imagery of corporate lifestyles and social values in the modern world.</p><hr><p>There’s an old joke about a stranger who, upon failing to get any useful directions from a local
resident, complains that the local “doesn’t know much.” The local replies, “yeah, but I ain’t lost”.
Philosophers of music are kind of like that stranger. Music is an important part of most people’s lives,
but they often don’t know much about it—even less about the philosophy that underlies music. Most
people do know what music they like, however. They have no trouble picking and choosing their
favorite bands or DJs (they aren’t lost). But they couldn’t begin to explain the musical forms and
theory involved in that music, or, more importantly, why it is that music is so important to them (they
can’t give directions). Exploring the evolution of Radiohead’s musical style and its unique character is a
good place to start.</p><p>In trying to understand the nature of music, it might seem that focusing on rock music, as a
category of popular music, is not a good choice. Specifically, rock music complicates matters because it
brings into play lyrics, that is, a non-musical written text. This aspect of rock may draw people’s
attention away from the music itself. (In fact, I bet you know many people who like a particular band or
song based mainly on the lyrics—maybe these people should take up poetry instead!) That’s why most
introductions to the philosophy of music deal exclusively with classical music, since classical music is
often both more complex structurally and contains no lyrics, allowing the student to focus upon the
purely musical structural components. Radiohead is not your average rock band, needless to say, and
their musical compositions have attracted the interest of many music lovers from the classical and jazz
communities. As the composer Paul Lansky (whose electronic music directly inspired the song
“Idioteque”) puts it: “There is nobody else like Radiohead, and the band’s work is interesting to many
who are not among the cohort of rock fans, although these form its largest audience.”</p><hr><p>1985-1992 formative years
