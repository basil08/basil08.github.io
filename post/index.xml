Which means a journey of 14 years came to an end. I have numerous delights, some regrets and plenty of memories to take with me. I have some to share too.
Teachers First of all, I want to thank every teacher who has taught me. From holding my hand to write an &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; in nursery to open discussions in Physics classes to painful lectures in Literature – I have taken a part of you all.</description></item><item><title>The Indian Sexual Taboo</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/the-indian-sexual-taboo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 15:28:23 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/the-indian-sexual-taboo/</guid><description>Recent unravelling of the Raj Kundra porn video business on online streaming platforms has raised many tantalizing questions on the effectiveness of the Indian judiciary. It is indeed shameful and comical to know that the judiciary is confused as to the definition of &amp;ldquo;pornography&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;obscene&amp;rdquo; and specific laws under which to prosecute Kundra and Co.
Why do porn industries flourish? Leaving prosecution and dissemination of judgement to more able individuals than me, I would like to raise few points about the other side of the coin: The Indian porn consumer base.</description></item><item><title>Freakonomics: Should you read it?</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/freakonomics-should-you-read-it/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jul 2021 11:14:14 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/freakonomics-should-you-read-it/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Why do drug-dealers still live with their mothers?&amp;rdquo;

Freakonomics is a study of bizarre, mundane and exceedingly interesting questions. It employs the arsenal of mathematical sophistication to unearth truths and secrets that are hidden from plain sight.</description></item><item><title>Rereading 'A Thousand Splendid Suns'</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/rereading-a-thousand-splendid-suns/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 18:37:19 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/rereading-a-thousand-splendid-suns/</guid><description>There are all these people constantly questioning me about my identity, my aspirations, my worth. What I want to do? What I want to be? So, I am forced to think about these questions. Indeed, what do I wanna do?
I reread the poignant &amp;ldquo;A Thousand Splendid Suns&amp;rdquo; by Khaled Hosseini. So, I have a habit, for better or worse, of poking around the central content to appreciate the big picture.</description></item><item><title>Is Governance Really So Difficult?</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/is-governance-really-so-difficult/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 13:15:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/is-governance-really-so-difficult/</guid><description>Why is taking economic decisions at a national level such a tantalizing task? Why do government policies fail (sometimes miserably)? Why are people still living on the streets under BPL?
You can expose yourself to an array of criticism and theories spun by supposedly thoughtful individuals at any cafe. These folks go on blurting how the present is worse than a decade ago and on and on. I had heard about their side, I wanted to know about the other side too.</description></item><item><title>Friendship</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/friendship/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 11:37:34 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/friendship/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;How many times had she, Hasina, and Giti said those same three words to each other, Laila wondered, said it without hesitation, after only two or three days of not seeing each other?
I missed you, Hasina. Oh, I missed you too. In Tariq&amp;rsquo;s grimace, Laila learned that boys differed from girls in this regard. They didn&amp;rsquo;t make a show of friendship. They felt no urge, no need, for this sort of talk.</description></item><item><title>My Reading Portfolio</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/my-reading-portfolio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 12:00:15 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/my-reading-portfolio/</guid><description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t met anybody as devoutly fanatic about books as I am in real life. This love of mine can turn aggressive, even generously self-depreciative, which is a source of concern. I maintain a digital library simply because there won&amp;rsquo;t be enough room for all the books if I build for myself a physical library (Now you know how to impress me 😉). I spend literally hours fretting about organization, intensely debating with myself what parameters to organize under, designing programs to maintain a catalog, devising makeshift ways to register progress and so on.</description></item><item><title>Notes: The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-the-millionaire-fastlane-by-mj-demarco/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 21:02:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-the-millionaire-fastlane-by-mj-demarco/</guid><description>Are you able to successfully leverage the opportunities at your disposal? That is the question that this book tries to answer and provides advice backed by the author&amp;rsquo;s own experiences. The book is written in a comfortable conversational style, including way too many metaphors and analogies.
The author, himself, has a remarkable lifestyle: starting a tech company during the dot-com bubble, growing it, selling it and so on. Below I have aggregated few core ideas from the book.</description></item><item><title>Migrating From Jekyll to Hugo</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/migrating-from-jekyll-to-hugo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 10:34:14 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/migrating-from-jekyll-to-hugo/</guid><description>This is a quick note for the convenience of the readers.
With a heave of pleasant sigh, I can inform you all that I am migrating from jekyll to hugo. Finally.
The only hindrance (so to speak) was the choice of a decent theme which, as you can see, has been accomplished. Hugo has a ton of features and conveniences that I would be foolish to not take advantage of. Archetypes, built-in shortcodes, KaTeX typesetting, taxonomies beside being so fast!</description></item><item><title>Most Scarce Resource</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/most-scarce-resource/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/most-scarce-resource/</guid><description>What is the single most scarce resource at the disposal of man?
The present.
It cannot be acquired or earned. It is available to all in equal measure. It cannot be claimed forever unlike knowledge or lost like friends. We may eschew society to do our biddings but all must surrender to this moment.
Anything that you are doing now is a liability and everything else you chose not to do are missed opportunities.</description></item><item><title>The Sun After A Thuderstorm</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/the-sun-after-a-thuderstorm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/the-sun-after-a-thuderstorm/</guid><description>There is something magical about the first sunshine after a thunderstorm. The coolness of the still wet ground and the warm sunshine vapourising the dew. The mist hanging low over the floor mixing with the musky smell of freshly spawned algae. The chirping of the songbird as they return to their nests mingling with the chattering of the hawkers and peddlers as they return to the streets below.</description></item><item><title>Notes: I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Ramit Sethi</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-by-ramit-sethi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-by-ramit-sethi/</guid><description>Sethi&amp;rsquo;s book, at it&amp;rsquo;s core, is a set of rules and tricks that can be applied by an aware and motivated individual to ensure a life of abundance relative to their current financial standings. Motivated to become rich himself (and hailing from India) at a young age, Sethi learnt from his blunders and noted his successes. He started blogging about his wins which eventually evolved into this book. Needless to say, his advice are well-researched, practical and tested.</description></item><item><title>What Makes You Powerful?</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/what-makes-you-powerful/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/what-makes-you-powerful/</guid><description>Do you want to know what makes one powerful?
It isn&amp;rsquo;t money or weapons or good health. It is the ability to find the weak side of strong things.</description></item><item><title>Notes: The Richest Man in Babylon by George S.

What is wealth? Wealth is a power. With wealth, many things are possible.
Essential Habits A man&amp;rsquo;s wealth is not in the purse he carries. A fat purse quickly empties if there be no golden stream to refill it.
Fate is unpredictable hence untrustworthy. It makes wanton spenders and misers alike.
Every surplus can earn for you.</description></item><item><title>Turn Down The Music</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/turn-down-the-music/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/turn-down-the-music/</guid><description>Yes, turn down the music
Throw away the booze and
Tell them the party&amp;rsquo;s over for

Rip the sky bleed,
crush every skull I find,
burn every fucking flower that blooms coz I want her. Yes, turn down the music
Throw away the booze and
Tell them the party&amp;rsquo;s over for

Was it so much to ask for your love?

On their first discourse, Kamala asks him what is he capable of doing that he can trade for money, pretty clothes, shoes, sweet perfumes and gifts for her. To which Siddhartha replies,
&amp;ldquo;I can think. I can wait. I can fast.&amp;rdquo;
I think that is a very profound answer and it will do ignorant fools like us much good if we make an attempt to comprehend it.</description></item><item><title>Going Public</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/going-public/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/going-public/</guid><description>Circumstances have forced me to mull over unprecedented actions. However, given the situation of the country and the world in general, I hardly think that is an exceptional decision.
The question stands, should I make my blog public? As rationality dictates, I would like to put forward few thoughts both pro- and anti-, some personal, some acquired.
It is not unknown to you that this is this blog&amp;rsquo;s new home on the Web.</description></item><item><title>My First Guitar</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/my-first-guitar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/my-first-guitar/</guid><description>I admit I have become lazy. I have not written about myself for a long time. And I apologize for polluting this space with movie and book thoughts. A lot of things have been happening (or should I say, the lack thereof?). But surely, the coolest things to happen is my guitar. Yes, ladies and gentlemen! My first guitar.
At this point, I am not clear whether the pandemic screwed me or I screwed myself.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts: Ready Player Two (Book)</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-ready-player-two-book/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-ready-player-two-book/</guid><description>WARNING: Literally the entire story is told. Proceed at your own risk.
TLDR If you plan to read it, you should look somewhere else.
I will keep it somewhere deep in my &amp;ldquo;Never to Read Again&amp;rdquo; stack and hope it disintegrated that way.
Yucks References! Apparently, we humans think that if something works for once than by extension more of it, no wait way more of it must be somehow better.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts: UNIX - History and Memoir (Book)</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-unix-history-and-memoir-book/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-unix-history-and-memoir-book/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s always good to know about the things you love the most. It somehow makes you love them even more. I am glad non-living things are not stupidly self-conscious and self-doubting like us and I can understand them more deeply than I can understand other humans.
Some mind(ful|less) blabberings With that said, I enjoyed this book. In Brian&amp;rsquo;s succint prose, he recollects the history of the mother of all operating systems: UNIX.</description></item><item><title>Dual Boot</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/dual-boot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/dual-boot/</guid><description>I experienced something profound and I want to share.
my experience with dual booting For three years, I have borne the pain of Windows. I hate it for being a black box. I love it for being a convenience. But I knew I wanted to get out. I was fearful. I have only one laptop and I have heard (oh lord, this word &amp;ldquo;heard&amp;rdquo;) very bad stories of entire hard disks getting purged.</description></item><item><title>Notes: Design for Hackers by David Kadavy</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-design-for-hackers-by-david-kadavy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-design-for-hackers-by-david-kadavy/</guid><description>Why Design? Your biggest asset - &amp;ldquo;Learn whatever you want to achieve your vision&amp;rdquo;. Good designs are timeless. They can awe people of any era. Fundamental soul of a human creation that expresses itself in successive outer layers of the product. Designing of a system comes before building it not after. Affect emotion, build credibility, earn trust. Don&amp;rsquo;t draw ponies. First visual interaction thus heuristic shortcut to judge credibility. Purpose | Medium and Technology | Aesthetics Good design choices are a set of ideas that must mature in the mind.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts: Design for Hackers (Book)</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-design-for-hackers-book/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-design-for-hackers-book/</guid><description>Design. An idea which I admit rather shamefully to not have paid any serious attention to (until now).
Design of a system happens before building not after.
This, it seems, is a general attitude towards design by builders and engineers or people who work on the guts or so called backend of a system as was coyly pointed out by the author himself.
Unfortunately, it is true. Design is something I have always thought of as an after thought in my projects at least uptil now.</description></item><item><title>Notes: Habits by James Clear</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-habits-by-james-clear/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-habits-by-james-clear/</guid><description>My Notes Introduction Majority fail in making habits because they try to make changes the wrong way.
It is easy to get obssessed with the result.
Never overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making better decisions on a daily basis.
Don&amp;rsquo;t focus on the destination. Focus on the path.

Think HTTP 0.9 or a less restraining Gopher.
TLDR If you haven&amp;rsquo;t checked out Gemini yet, you totally should. This is a HTTP proxy to the actual gemini site.
Why Gemini? I really value your time and understand you have better things to do. So, I&amp;rsquo;ll cut down on formalities and introductions and preludes and yada yada.</description></item><item><title>Specialisation</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/specialisation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/specialisation/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is-this-about">What is this about?&lt;/h2>

Living in the now, the present versus living for the future. This is not a mutually exclusive choice. One must possess both qualities and be able to switch back and forth effortlessly between them.
Living for the future is stressful in the present but generally blissful for the future. You might argue that this must be the optimum choice but the conflict is you are preparing for something non existent and moreover, expending your present to do so and effective using what you can only ever experience, the present.</description></item><item><title>Systems and Everything Else</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/systems-and-everything-else/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/systems-and-everything-else/</guid><description>This is probably the best life skill I have come across in a while that I wish to talk about.
