<h2 id=why-do-i-have-to-buy-music>Why do I have to buy music?</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, because I want to. But seriously, why in a world of Spotify and pirated downloadable songs would I have the brilliant idea to <em>buy</em> music?</p>
<p>As I said, because I wanted to. And really can you ever aspire to reason with a human who is blinded by desire? So that&rsquo;s that. I wanted to pay my tribute to the most fascinating thing I have discovered this year. I wanted to pay my respect to the band which gave me my first ever taste of stardom. And let&rsquo;s be frank, somewhere deep down I wanted to believe I&rsquo;m cool (cause human vanity after all).</p>
<p>Moreover, I wanted to prove myself. To whom? Myself? Nah. To my parents. I wanted to show them that I am capable of earning money and spending it on stuff I desire. I wanted them to know that I can be free. I wanted to make a statement. I want them to let me be myself.</p>
<h3 id=a-disturbing-bug-in-my-head>A Disturbing Bug in my head</h3>
<p>The culmination of so many days' of hardwork, research and passion finally paid off. Acquiring these CDs had become more than an obsession/desire for me. It became my emotion.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no idea how I ended up being so ignorant as to what my target is and what I&rsquo;m doing. But then I guess, this is what being a human is like. Imagine all those big shots and important people failing their responsibilities and then eventually who suffers?</p>
<p>Apart from that side rant that was disturbing me for sometime now, I feel accomplished in a small way.</p>
<p>I financed the whole endeavor on my own from the compensation I got for my gig work for Topcoder.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-i-buy>What did I buy?</h2>
<p>To be extremely honest, the idea to buy a CT CD came to me after I listened to HOLV. And it was just one CD. What could eventually go wrong? I thought to myself. But with some contribution from human desire coupled with marketing techniques exercised by Norman and my own vanity, I ended up ordering 3 CDs - Heaven or Las Vegas(1990), Treasure(1984) and Stars and Topsoil (Compilation). All three CDs are, of course, masterpieces. And I love them!</p>

<p><a href=https://normanrecords.com>Norman Records</a>.</p>
<p>I wasted quite sometime in vain during the initial days of the undertaking to convince myself that I can find a CT album here in the music shops of Kolkata. My supposition may have been correct say 20 years ago but today only remnants remain of this bizarre craze I have happened to nurture. For second, Music World burned down in an accident in 2010. I regret that. I ordered my CDs on October 26, 2020 and they arrived on November 27th, 2020.</p>
<p>My learning out of this experience was this: If you want something, spend money for it. There is absolutely no compromise for authenticity and quality.</p>
<h2 id=what-next>What next?</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t torn the seals of HOLV and Stars <em>yet</em>. I think they are too precious and are thus better off being untouched and pure. (üòÖ Weird) So, yea, anything we desire remains an obsession only until we haven&rsquo;t owned it. Strange, this human nature really.</p>
<p>I plan to buy Blue Bell Knoll and am eyeing the 4 CD Treasure Hiding boxset for next year.</p>
<p>It sure has been a hell of a ride and I enjoyed every bit of it!</p>
