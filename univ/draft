~~The Accidental IITian~~
The first 15 days of online survival
hostel meet, rules and regulations
why rules? diversity: economic, cultural, language
scanning new people on IG
feeling alone
feeling small
inferiority complex
static, difficulty in class
self study
mtl mishap


~~Reaching IITD (Train journey to Delhi)~~
First _real_ day at IITD (the onboarding day)
I'm an Udaigiri Eagle! (hostels are like clans)
unfathomable freedom
language nuances b/w kolkata and delhi
The world left behind

On Gaming:
I think when you find out the how of something, it ceases to be magical. I loved to game when I was a kid (who doesn't?). It was this special, incomprehensible thing that gave me joy. But now, I don't feel like it. However interesting a game might be, my mind will always remind itself of the fact that it is nothing but a bunch of bits being manipulated and then, I'll feel this immense guilt of wasting my time. I have a physical aversion to CoD. The icon keeps glaring at me from the desktop but I just don't feel like "wasting my time". I'd rather "make" a game. Maybe, just maybe uni can change that.
