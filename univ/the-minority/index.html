But since 20 days <em>have</em> elapsed, let&rsquo;s make it a narration of my experience so far at IITD.</p><p>I appeared for my first university minor exams, a new experience. I met seniors and club representatives and got myself involved in a small development project for Rendezvous, our institute&rsquo;s cultural fest. I arranged for a bicycle from a senior and got it repaired from the shop yesterday. The Omicron variant is out at large, and the management is apprehensive of keeping students on campus. Most of my wingmates and friends have returned home. I just don&rsquo;t feel like going home, that 24-hour journey, all the packing, I hate that. Besides, the Delhi cold is suiting my skin in a way (Although it&rsquo;s too dry than I want it to be). As a result, I&rsquo;m alone in my wing with few other boys, typing away at my laptop, looking out the window, and strumming the guitar I borrowed until mine arrives. No, but really, I like not having to make small talk with people, being disrupted doing something important, putting my thought into behaving.</p><p>I was sitting in my room studying calculus (my MTL100 quiz wasn&rsquo;t particularly good) at New Year&rsquo;s Eve. There was a knock at the door, and suddenly my friends bashed into my room. Now, I couldn&rsquo;t say no to their proposition that we order something and wind down, and we ended up ordering pizza and stuff. But that isn&rsquo;t the point. That night I discussed movies and pop culture with a friend from EE dept. and he remarked, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find yourself in the minority here.&rdquo; And try as I could, I cannot get that remark out of my head. If I find myself in the minority here, is this the place for me? I couldn&rsquo;t help but think, he&rsquo;s right. I have found myself interacting with students who had to suppress every bit of creative enthusiasm they had only to clear the JEEs. I found myself detesting our education system. These are not stories one reads in newspapers; they are real people with real passions. I hope to find a reciprocative, amicable peer group here. Because I&rsquo;m so fucking tired of being alone. There was a dialogue in the BBC series <em>&ldquo;Sherlock&rdquo;</em> by Benedict Cumberbatch, &ldquo;The frailty of genius, John. It needs an audience.&rdquo;</p></article></section><footer><div><p class="f6 gray mt6 lh-copy">© 2020 <a href=https://twitter.com/itbwtsh>Basil Labib</a> | Made with ❤️ using <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> & <a href=https://github.com/siegerts/hugo-theme-basic>Basic</a></p></div></footer><script src=//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.14.2/highlight.min.js></script>
