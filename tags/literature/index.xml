I do not seek to compete with them. What follows is my perception of Hamlet, a sketch so if you will, from a modern day perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamlet is a complex character. I have strived to deduce Hamlet strictly from the source text and not get influenced by writings elsewhere because I feel external analysis somehow shrouds (glorifies or diminishs, whichever) the essence of what Shakespeare intended. I also acknowledge there are passages and portions that are still unclear to me. I take them as deficiencies on my part and the excellence of the play.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
