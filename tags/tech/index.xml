I&amp;rsquo;ll also explain each step and discuss the reason for preference of a particular way of implementation over others. Unlike other &amp;ldquo;recipes&amp;rdquo; on the web, this will give you insight into the workflow of building software.
This may seem like a long post because it is. I suggest you to follow along in chunks so you don&amp;rsquo;t get overwhelmed.</description></item><item><title>Migrating From Jekyll to Hugo</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/migrating-from-jekyll-to-hugo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 10:34:14 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/migrating-from-jekyll-to-hugo/</guid><description>This is a quick note for the convenience of the readers.
With a heave of pleasant sigh, I can inform you all that I am migrating from jekyll to hugo. Finally.
The only hindrance (so to speak) was the choice of a decent theme which, as you can see, has been accomplished. Hugo has a ton of features and conveniences that I would be foolish to not take advantage of. Archetypes, built-in shortcodes, KaTeX typesetting, taxonomies beside being so fast!</description></item></channel></rss>
