Today, critics laud his work as quintessential &amp;ldquo;American&amp;rdquo; in spirit as he developed a distinctive signature style. His personal life was fraught with toil and resentment as he watched his contemporaries rise to fame and fortune. He was a married man who had no children and his wife stood as a pillar of support, augmenting his intellect, emotion and career. He was a shy, quiet, somewhat reclusive artist who was appalled by abstract modernism and its advent in the American art landscape. He was cynical of critics who failed to share his viewpoint that art is an expression of an artist&amp;rsquo;s emotional conscience.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
