 I tell you that I have a long way to go before I am – where one begins&amp;hellip;
 &lt;/blockquote>
 &lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>These are Rilke&amp;rsquo;s first words that I read. I had no prior acquaintance with either the man or his writings, save for a curious Google search on a Cocteau Twins&amp;rsquo; song called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkvmjniEW0E">Rilkean Heart&lt;/a>. And yet, I immediately felt a tug towards these words, gyrating around them, twisting and turning them in my head, trying to make sense of it. Perhaps, just perhaps, Rilke would know the storm that was raging in me?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Turn Down The Music</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/turn-down-the-music/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/turn-down-the-music/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Yes, turn down the music&lt;br>
Throw away the booze and&lt;br>
Tell them the party&amp;rsquo;s over for&lt;br>
she isn&amp;rsquo;t here.&lt;br>
Rip the sky bleed,&lt;br>
crush every skull I find,&lt;br>
burn every fucking flower &lt;br>
that blooms coz I want her. &lt;br>
Yes, turn down the music&lt;br>
Throw away the booze and&lt;br>
Tell them the party&amp;rsquo;s over for&lt;br>
she isn&amp;rsquo;t here.&lt;br>
Was it so much to ask for your love?&lt;br>
I dreamt too much about us&lt;br>
But you were too conceited. Now,&lt;br>
Switch off the lights &lt;br>
And, turn down the music&lt;br>
Throw away the booze and&lt;br>
Tell them the party&amp;rsquo;s over for&lt;br>
she isn&amp;rsquo;t here. &lt;br>
— b.l.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
