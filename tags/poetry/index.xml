Throw away the booze and
Tell them the party&amp;rsquo;s over for

Rip the sky bleed,
crush every skull I find,
burn every fucking flower that blooms coz I want her. Yes, turn down the music
Throw away the booze and
Tell them the party&amp;rsquo;s over for
she isn&amp;rsquo;t here.
Was it so much to ask for your love?
I dreamt too much about us</description></item></channel></rss>
