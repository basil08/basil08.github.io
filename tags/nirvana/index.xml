&lt;p&gt;Polly became a conversation starter, an ice-breaker, a household catalyst for people everywhere to talk about woman abuse. Polly is a protest song, a song born out of the anguish that Kurt felt for the condition and treatment of woman in the society. It has often been dubbed as Nirvana&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;darkest&amp;rdquo; song – which, in my opinion, is a fairly glorified sobriquet because most of Nirvana&amp;rsquo;s songs are dark and ghastly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
