Published in 1963, Jar is one of the prominent texts on feminism and the vocalisation of a woman&amp;rsquo;s apprehensions, rights and freedom. Plath&amp;rsquo;s words, like brazen dagger, are used today in protest marches as well as analysed in literary circles.
Sylvia Plath
Jar stands as testimony to the ephemeral skills of Plath as a writer.</description></item><item><title>Love As An Illegitimate Byproduct</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/love-as-an-illegitimate-byproduct/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 10:18:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/love-as-an-illegitimate-byproduct/</guid><description>Evolutionary biology has always fascinated me. I have marveled at the ingenuity of evolutionists drawing up elegant theories, piecing together the most bizarre of observations with a string of sound reasoning. I guess the quality of making logical sense of the alien world we find ourselves in makes evolution appeal to me.
Recently, I read Jared Diamond&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Why Sex is Fun?&amp;rdquo;, a short book (a series of essays really) about human sexuality and how it differs so radically from every other species we know of.</description></item><item><title>Freakonomics: Should you read it?</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/freakonomics-should-you-read-it/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jul 2021 11:14:14 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/freakonomics-should-you-read-it/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Why do drug-dealers still live with their mothers?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Are Sumo wrestlers corrupt?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Legalized abortion led to decreasing crime rates&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Are real-estate agents really acting in your best interest?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Does a child&amp;rsquo;s name have any effect on their lives?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Do parents really matter?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Are swimming pools more dangerous for kids than guns?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Why should teachers cheat?&amp;rdquo;
Freakonomics is a study of bizarre, mundane and exceedingly interesting questions. It employs the arsenal of mathematical sophistication to unearth truths and secrets that are hidden from plain sight.</description></item><item><title>Rereading 'A Thousand Splendid Suns'</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/rereading-a-thousand-splendid-suns/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 18:37:19 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/rereading-a-thousand-splendid-suns/</guid><description>There are all these people constantly questioning me about my identity, my aspirations, my worth. What I want to do? What I want to be? So, I am forced to think about these questions. Indeed, what do I wanna do?
I reread the poignant &amp;ldquo;A Thousand Splendid Suns&amp;rdquo; by Khaled Hosseini. So, I have a habit, for better or worse, of poking around the central content to appreciate the big picture.</description></item><item><title>My Reading Portfolio</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/my-reading-portfolio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 12:00:15 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/my-reading-portfolio/</guid><description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t met anybody as devoutly fanatic about books as I am in real life. This love of mine can turn aggressive, even generously self-depreciative, which is a source of concern. I maintain a digital library simply because there won&amp;rsquo;t be enough room for all the books if I build for myself a physical library (Now you know how to impress me 😉). I spend literally hours fretting about organization, intensely debating with myself what parameters to organize under, designing programs to maintain a catalog, devising makeshift ways to register progress and so on.</description></item><item><title>Notes: The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-the-millionaire-fastlane-by-mj-demarco/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 21:02:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-the-millionaire-fastlane-by-mj-demarco/</guid><description>Are you able to successfully leverage the opportunities at your disposal? That is the question that this book tries to answer and provides advice backed by the author&amp;rsquo;s own experiences. The book is written in a comfortable conversational style, including way too many metaphors and analogies.
The author, himself, has a remarkable lifestyle: starting a tech company during the dot-com bubble, growing it, selling it and so on. Below I have aggregated few core ideas from the book.</description></item><item><title>Think, Wait and Fast</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/think-wait-and-fast/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/think-wait-and-fast/</guid><description>In the book &amp;ldquo;Siddhartha&amp;rdquo; by Herman Hesse – the protagonist, who is a Samana (a homeless hermit), is enchanted by the beauty of a woman named Kamala. On their first discourse, Kamala asks him what is he capable of doing that he can trade for money, pretty clothes, shoes, sweet perfumes and gifts for her. To which Siddhartha replies,
&amp;ldquo;I can think. I can wait. I can fast.&amp;rdquo;
I think that is a very profound answer and it will do ignorant fools like us much good if we make an attempt to comprehend it.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts: Ready Player Two (Book)</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-ready-player-two-book/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-ready-player-two-book/</guid><description>WARNING: Literally the entire story is told. Proceed at your own risk.
TLDR If you plan to read it, you should look somewhere else.
I will keep it somewhere deep in my &amp;ldquo;Never to Read Again&amp;rdquo; stack and hope it disintegrated that way.
Yucks References! Apparently, we humans think that if something works for once than by extension more of it, no wait way more of it must be somehow better.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts: UNIX - History and Memoir (Book)</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-unix-history-and-memoir-book/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-unix-history-and-memoir-book/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s always good to know about the things you love the most. It somehow makes you love them even more. I am glad non-living things are not stupidly self-conscious and self-doubting like us and I can understand them more deeply than I can understand other humans.
Some mind(ful|less) blabberings With that said, I enjoyed this book. In Brian&amp;rsquo;s succint prose, he recollects the history of the mother of all operating systems: UNIX.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts: The Selfish Gene (Book)</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-the-selfish-gene-book/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-the-selfish-gene-book/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
