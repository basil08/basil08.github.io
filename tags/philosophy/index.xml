&lt;p>The other day, my sister and I were having this rather enlightening and philosophical conversation on how to navigate life. We&amp;rsquo;re almost adults so it&amp;rsquo;s high time we learn things that schools and parents won&amp;rsquo;t teach us.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I can think. I can wait. I can fast.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I think that is a very profound answer and it will do ignorant fools like us much good if we make an attempt to comprehend it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
