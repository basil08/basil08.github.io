We&amp;rsquo;re almost adults so it&amp;rsquo;s high time we learn things that schools and parents won&amp;rsquo;t teach us.

It is analogous to a video game with opportunities and options at every turn and the chosen options leading to other opportunities, good or bad, but completely alienating us from the opportunities we have missed.</description></item><item><title>Think, Wait and Fast</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/think-wait-and-fast/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/think-wait-and-fast/</guid><description>In the book &amp;ldquo;Siddhartha&amp;rdquo; by Herman Hesse – the protagonist, who is a Samana (a homeless hermit), is enchanted by the beauty of a woman named Kamala. On their first discourse, Kamala asks him what is he capable of doing that he can trade for money, pretty clothes, shoes, sweet perfumes and gifts for her. To which Siddhartha replies,
&amp;ldquo;I can think. I can wait. I can fast.&amp;rdquo;
I think that is a very profound answer and it will do ignorant fools like us much good if we make an attempt to comprehend it.</description></item></channel></rss>
