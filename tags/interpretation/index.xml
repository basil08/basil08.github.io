A second viewing few days back, made me observe relationships and philosophies that escaped me in the first attempt. There are good reasons why &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; is discussed by critics even today from as varied perspectives as social, political, scientific, philosophical and of course, technological and has injected such appealing concepts and ideas in the public imagination that they have managed to pass into our vocabulary and lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
