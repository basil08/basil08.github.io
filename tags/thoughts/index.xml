&lt;p>Morgan Housel&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;The Psychology of Money&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> is less of a technical book and more of a collection of wisdom and wishful advices. It is N. Taleb&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Bed of Procrustes&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> augmented with real life anecdotes, morsels of history, and a lot of quotations. Although Housel professes a very conservative and frugal approach to managing money, his advice cannot be disputed without a very good counter argument. The cautious models, frameworks, and signposts laid out in the book would prevent an investor from being foolish and that Housel says is too easy to be in the modern financial system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Web 3.0 and The Metaverse Mania</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/web-3.0-and-the-metaverse-mania/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 19:54:34 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/web-3.0-and-the-metaverse-mania/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is a shot in Steven Spielberg&amp;rsquo;s 2018 science fiction &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677720/">&amp;ldquo;Ready Player One&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> where the protagonist, Wade, sitting in a shack in Columbus puts on a VR headset and is transported to the planet of Incipio where all avatars are born when they enter the OASIS. They can morph into any characters, cartoon, or monster. Customise how they look and sound and smell. Buy virtual assets and fight in hunts on a planet called Doom (Watch the movie if this is lost on you). Although these are mere imagination spewed from the mind of a 80s culture maniac, how would you feel if I tell you this is exactly the place we are headed?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar and feminism</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/sylvia-plath-the-bell-jar-and-feminism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 11:27:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/sylvia-plath-the-bell-jar-and-feminism/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;span style="display: inline-block; font-size: 30px; font-weight: 600;">"What I hate &lt;/span> &lt;em>is the thought of being under a man&amp;rsquo;s thumb&amp;quot;&lt;/em>, Sylvia fearlessly thundered in her only published novel &amp;ldquo;The Bell Jar&amp;rdquo;. Published in 1963, &lt;em>Jar&lt;/em> is one of the prominent texts on feminism and the vocalisation of a woman&amp;rsquo;s apprehensions, rights and freedom. Sylvia&amp;rsquo;s words, like brazen dagger, are used today in protest marches as well as analysed in literary circles.&lt;/p>

Garlands (1982), their debut, was too much on the punk and goth style, a desperate searching phase for their identity which was fulfilled by Treasure (1984), a commendable opus in itself. But it is Heaven or Las Vegas or a song therein, that the CT are most remembered for.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>'Please myself': An interpretation 30 years later</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/please-myself-an-interpretation-30-years-later/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 08:02:53 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/please-myself-an-interpretation-30-years-later/</guid><description>&lt;p>Polly, a common American girl name, quickly rose to fame as the 6th songtrack on Nirvana&amp;rsquo;s second album, Nevermind, one of the best-selling albums of all time, having sold over 30 million copies since its release in 1991.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Polly became a conversation starter, an ice-breaker, a household catalyst for people everywhere to talk about woman abuse. Polly is a protest song, a song born out of the anguish that Kurt felt for the condition and treatment of woman in the society. It has often been dubbed as Nirvana&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;darkest&amp;rdquo; song – which, in my opinion, is a fairly glorified sobriquet because most of Nirvana&amp;rsquo;s songs are dark and ghastly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>To be or not to be: Understanding Hamlet</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/to-be-or-not-to-be-understanding-hamlet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 10:20:23 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/to-be-or-not-to-be-understanding-hamlet/</guid><description>&lt;p>Volumes have been written on the &amp;ldquo;meaning&amp;rdquo; of Hamlet (the play) by more qualified people than me. I do not seek to compete with them. What follows is my perception of Hamlet, a sketch so if you will, from a modern day perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hamlet is a complex character. I have strived to deduce Hamlet strictly from the source text and not get influenced by writings elsewhere because I feel external analysis somehow shrouds (glorifies or diminishs, whichever) the essence of what Shakespeare intended. I also acknowledge there are passages and portions that are still unclear to me. I take them as deficiencies on my part and the excellence of the play.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Closer Look at 'Inside Job'</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/a-closer-look-at-inside-job/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 16:56:47 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/a-closer-look-at-inside-job/</guid><description>&lt;!--

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Inside Job&amp;rdquo; is a 2010 documentary written, directed and produced by Charles Ferguson on the 2008 global financial crisis. It won the Oscar in the &amp;ldquo;Best Documentary Feature&amp;rdquo; category in 2011. Notwithstanding, it makes for an enlightening and thrilling watch that every citizen, who cares about where their hard earned money goes, should watch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This documentary is not an easy watch that one can grab on a lazy afternoon comfortable on their couch. It has complex sounding terms and concepts that should keep one on the edge of their seat. As those financial experts makes the layman believe, &amp;ldquo;What we do is far more complicated for you to understand so you better leave us alone as we do it.&amp;rdquo; They are soft-headed people who will make one feel witless and run away with their money. That is exactly what happened in 2008.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rereading 'A Thousand Splendid Suns'</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/rereading-a-thousand-splendid-suns/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 18:37:19 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/rereading-a-thousand-splendid-suns/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are all these people constantly questioning me about my identity, my aspirations, &lt;em>my worth&lt;/em>. What I want to do? &lt;em>What I want to be?&lt;/em> So, I am forced to think about these questions. Indeed, what do I wanna do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I reread the poignant &amp;ldquo;A Thousand Splendid Suns&amp;rdquo; by Khaled Hosseini. So, I have a habit, for better or worse, of poking around the central content to appreciate the big picture. I read a Wikipedia article on Afghanistan&amp;rsquo;s history. I found it interesting. And included 3 books on Afghan history in my library – looking forward to &amp;ldquo;A Brief History of Afghanistan&amp;rdquo; by Shaista Wahab et. al.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is Governance Really So Difficult?</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/is-governance-really-so-difficult/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 13:15:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/is-governance-really-so-difficult/</guid><description>&lt;p>Why is taking economic decisions at a national level such a tantalizing task? Why do government policies fail (sometimes miserably)? Why are people still living on the streets under BPL?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can expose yourself to an array of criticism and theories spun by supposedly thoughtful individuals at any cafe. These folks go on blurting how the present is worse than a decade ago and on and on. I had heard about their side, I wanted to know about the other side too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Notes: The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-the-millionaire-fastlane-by-mj-demarco/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 21:02:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-the-millionaire-fastlane-by-mj-demarco/</guid><description>&lt;p>Are you able to successfully leverage the opportunities at your disposal? That is the question that this book tries to answer and provides advice backed by the author&amp;rsquo;s own experiences. The book is written in a comfortable conversational style, including &lt;em>way too many&lt;/em> metaphors and analogies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The author, himself, has a remarkable lifestyle: starting a tech company during the dot-com bubble, growing it, selling it and so on. Below I have aggregated few core ideas from the book. Enjoy!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Sun After A Thuderstorm</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/the-sun-after-a-thuderstorm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/the-sun-after-a-thuderstorm/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is something magical about the first sunshine after a thunderstorm. The coolness of the still wet ground and the warm sunshine vapourising the dew. The mist hanging low over the floor mixing with the musky smell of freshly spawned algae. The chirping of the songbird as they return to their nests mingling with the chattering of the hawkers and peddlers as they return to the streets below.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts: UNIX - History and Memoir (Book)</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-unix-history-and-memoir-book/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-unix-history-and-memoir-book/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s always good to know about the things you love the most. It somehow makes you love them even more. I am glad non-living things are not stupidly self-conscious and self-doubting like us and I can understand them more deeply than I can understand other humans.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="some-mindfulless-blabberings">Some mind(ful|less) blabberings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With that said, I enjoyed this book. In Brian&amp;rsquo;s succint prose, he recollects the history of &lt;em>the mother of all operating systems&lt;/em>: UNIX. And along the way, describes the sideways development that it encouraged such as the development of C (the “lingua franca of computing”), various timeless tools like &lt;code>grep&lt;/code>, &lt;code>awk&lt;/code>, &lt;code>sed&lt;/code>, &lt;code>yacc&lt;/code>, &lt;code>lex&lt;/code>, &lt;code>make&lt;/code>, document formatters and so on. He talks about what lead to the development of UNIX and ruminates on the kind of environment contagious to such breakthroughs. Unfettered management, fun atmosphere, great minds, stable funding and the freedom and willingness to solve real-world problems. He also points out and clear a lot of the admittedly confusing history that is the legacy of Unix as the (licensed) source code of Unix reached Berkeley. As he correctly pointed out, AT&amp;amp;T tried to &amp;ldquo;lock the barn door after the crown jewels had flown the coop&amp;rdquo;. And then we had BSD, Minix, Linux, Xenix and yada yada.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts: The Selfish Gene (Book)</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-the-selfish-gene-book/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-the-selfish-gene-book/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
