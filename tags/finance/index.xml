&lt;p&gt;Morgan Housel&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Psychology of Money&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; is less of a technical book and more of a collection of wisdom and wishful advices. It is N. Taleb&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bed of Procrustes&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; augmented with real life anecdotes, morsels of history, and a lot of quotations. Although Housel professes a very conservative and frugal approach to managing money, his advice cannot be disputed without a very good counter argument. The cautious models, frameworks, and signposts laid out in the book would prevent an investor from being foolish and that Housel says is too easy to be in the modern financial system.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Notes: The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-the-millionaire-fastlane-by-mj-demarco/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 21:02:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-the-millionaire-fastlane-by-mj-demarco/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Are you able to successfully leverage the opportunities at your disposal? That is the question that this book tries to answer and provides advice backed by the author&amp;rsquo;s own experiences. The book is written in a comfortable conversational style, including &lt;em&gt;way too many&lt;/em&gt; metaphors and analogies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author, himself, has a remarkable lifestyle: starting a tech company during the dot-com bubble, growing it, selling it and so on. Below I have aggregated few core ideas from the book. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Notes: I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Ramit Sethi</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-by-ramit-sethi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-by-ramit-sethi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Sethi&amp;rsquo;s book, at it&amp;rsquo;s core, is a set of rules and tricks that can be applied by an aware and motivated individual to ensure a life of abundance relative to their current financial standings. Motivated to become rich himself (and hailing from India) at a young age, Sethi learnt from his blunders and noted his successes. He started blogging about his wins which eventually evolved into this book. Needless to say, his advice are well-researched, practical and tested. Do they work? It seems to.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Notes: The Richest Man in Babylon by George S.

&lt;h2 id="what-is-wealth"&gt;What is wealth?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth is a power. &lt;strong&gt;With wealth, many things are possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="essential-habits"&gt;Essential Habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man&amp;rsquo;s wealth is not in the purse he carries. &lt;strong&gt;A fat purse quickly empties if there be no golden stream to refill it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fate is unpredictable hence untrustworthy.&lt;/strong&gt; It makes wanton spenders and misers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every surplus can earn for you. And every revenue on that can earn for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
