A second viewing few days back, made me observe relationships and philosophies that escaped me in the first attempt. There are good reasons why The Matrix is discussed by critics even today from as varied perspectives as social, political, scientific, philosophical and of course, technological and has injected such appealing concepts and ideas in the public imagination that they have managed to pass into our vocabulary and lifestyles.</description></item><item><title>Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar and feminism</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/sylvia-plath-the-bell-jar-and-feminism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 11:27:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/sylvia-plath-the-bell-jar-and-feminism/</guid><description>"What I hate is the thought of being under a man&amp;rsquo;s thumb&amp;quot;, Sylvia fearlessly thundered in her only published novel &amp;ldquo;The Bell Jar&amp;rdquo;. Published in 1963, Jar is one of the prominent texts on feminism and the vocalisation of a woman&amp;rsquo;s apprehensions, rights and freedom. Sylvia&amp;rsquo;s words, like brazen dagger, are used today in protest marches as well as analysed in literary circles.

Jar stands as testimony to the ephemeral skills of Sylvia as a writer.</description></item><item><title>The IIT Dream: Decoding India's lust for engineers</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/the-iit-dream-decoding-indias-lust-for-engineers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 14:05:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/the-iit-dream-decoding-indias-lust-for-engineers/</guid><description>India suffers from an unusual sort of disease today. Spotted on walls in metropolises and small towns alike, will be colorful posters with portrait sized photos of teenaged students, posing in institute branded t-shirts with big proud smiles on their faces and occasionally V signs made with fingers. Accompanying them will be a number AIR XXXX, decreasing in font size and prominence as the numbers grow larger as if to suggest a decrease in the importance of the student and their aptitude.</description></item><item><title>31 Years of 'Heaven or Las Vegas'</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/31-years-of-heaven-or-las-vegas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 10:18:49 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/31-years-of-heaven-or-las-vegas/</guid><description>Most CT fans agree (and frankly, there ain&amp;rsquo;t many) that Heaven or Las Vegas is their definitive production: ephemeral and sublime, cocky song titles and discernable vocals, sweet sounds and fragments of bitter lyrics, it is a very Twins album in spirit. Garlands (1982), their debut, was too much on the punk and goth style, a desperate searching phase for their identity which was fulfilled by Treasure (1984), a commendable opus in itself.</description></item><item><title>'Please myself': An interpretation 30 years later</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/please-myself-an-interpretation-30-years-later/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 08:02:53 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/please-myself-an-interpretation-30-years-later/</guid><description>Polly, a common American girl name, quickly rose to fame as the 6th songtrack on Nirvana&amp;rsquo;s second album, Nevermind, one of the best-selling albums of all time, having sold over 30 million copies since its release in 1991.
Polly became a conversation starter, an ice-breaker, a household catalyst for people everywhere to talk about woman abuse. Polly is a protest song, a song born out of the anguish that Kurt felt for the condition and treatment of woman in the society.</description></item><item><title>Academic Dishonesty</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/academic-dishonesty/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Sep 2021 11:50:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/academic-dishonesty/</guid><description>Today is September 5th which is celebrated as Teacher&amp;rsquo;s Day in India on the birth anniversary of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, an eminent educator, teacher and the first Vice President of India. As Indian students reach out to pay respect to their teachers via various gestures such as feet embracing albeit digitally this year, I wish to take this opportunity to speak about a much graver issue in the Indian education scenario today.</description></item><item><title>Remembering My Teachers</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/remembering-my-teachers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Sep 2021 10:20:28 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/remembering-my-teachers/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;The right kind of education begins with the educator, who must understand himself and be free from established patterns of thought; for what he is that he imparts. If he has not been rightly educated, what can he teach except the same mechanical knowledge on which he himself has been brought up?&amp;rdquo;
~J Krishnamurti NR Narayan Murthy, the founder of Infosys, recounted three incidents in his life that taught him core human values and left an indelible mark on him.</description></item><item><title>The Sensuality of Rilke's Love Poems</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/the-sensuality-of-rilkes-love-poems/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 09:04:40 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/the-sensuality-of-rilkes-love-poems/</guid><description>I tell you that I have a long way to go before I am – where one begins&amp;hellip; These are Rilke&amp;rsquo;s first words that I read. I had no prior acquaintance with either the man or his writings, save for a curious Google search on a Cocteau Twins' song called Rilkean Heart. And yet, I immediately felt a tug towards these words, gyrating around them, twisting and turning them in my head, trying to make sense of it.</description></item><item><title>Love As An Illegitimate Byproduct</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/love-as-an-illegitimate-byproduct/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 10:18:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/love-as-an-illegitimate-byproduct/</guid><description>Evolutionary biology has always fascinated me. I have marveled at the ingenuity of evolutionists drawing up elegant theories, piecing together the most bizarre of observations with a string of sound reasoning. I guess the quality of making logical sense of the alien world we find ourselves in makes evolution appeal to me.
Recently, I read Jared Diamond&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Why Sex is Fun?&amp;rdquo;, a short book (a series of essays really) about human sexuality and how it differs so radically from every other species we know of.</description></item><item><title>How to Take Correct Decisions</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/how-to-take-correct-decisions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 10:33:32 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/how-to-take-correct-decisions/</guid><description>Prologue The other day, my sister and I were having this rather enlightening and philosophical conversation on how to navigate life. We&amp;rsquo;re almost adults so it&amp;rsquo;s high time we learn things that schools and parents won&amp;rsquo;t teach us.
The Problem A human life is a game of decision making. It is analogous to a video game with opportunities and options at every turn and the chosen options leading to other opportunities, good or bad, but completely alienating us from the opportunities we have missed.</description></item><item><title>To be or not to be: Understanding Hamlet</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/to-be-or-not-to-be-understanding-hamlet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 10:20:23 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/to-be-or-not-to-be-understanding-hamlet/</guid><description>Volumes have been written on the &amp;ldquo;meaning&amp;rdquo; of Hamlet (the play) by more qualified people than me. I do not seek to compete with them. What follows is my perception of Hamlet, a sketch so if you will, from a modern day perspective.
Hamlet is a complex character. I have strived to deduce Hamlet strictly from the source text and not get influenced by writings elsewhere because I feel external analysis somehow shrouds (glorifies or diminishs, whichever) the essence of what Shakespeare intended.</description></item><item><title>A Closer Look at 'Inside Job'</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/a-closer-look-at-inside-job/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 16:56:47 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/a-closer-look-at-inside-job/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Inside Job&amp;rdquo; is a 2010 documentary written, directed and produced by Charles Ferguson on the 2008 global financial crisis. It won the Oscar in the &amp;ldquo;Best Documentary Feature&amp;rdquo; category in 2011. Notwithstanding, it makes for an enlightening and thrilling watch that every citizen, who cares about where their hard earned money goes, should watch.
This documentary is not an easy watch that one can grab on a lazy afternoon comfortable on their couch.</description></item><item><title>My School Journey</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/my-school-journey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 23:34:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/my-school-journey/</guid><description>Few days back, I graduated high school. Which means a journey of 14 years came to an end. I have numerous delights, some regrets and plenty of memories to take with me. I have some to share too.
Teachers First of all, I want to thank every teacher who has taught me. From holding my hand to write an &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; in nursery to open discussions in Physics classes to painful lectures in Literature – I have taken a part of you all.</description></item><item><title>The Indian Sexual Taboo</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/the-indian-sexual-taboo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 15:28:23 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/the-indian-sexual-taboo/</guid><description>Recent unravelling of the Raj Kundra porn video business on online streaming platforms has raised many tantalizing questions on the effectiveness of the Indian judiciary. It is indeed shameful and comical to know that the judiciary is confused as to the definition of &amp;ldquo;pornography&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;obscene&amp;rdquo; and specific laws under which to prosecute Kundra and Co.
Why do porn industries flourish? Leaving prosecution and dissemination of judgement to more able individuals than me, I would like to raise few points about the other side of the coin: The Indian porn consumer base.</description></item><item><title>Freakonomics: Should you read it?</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/freakonomics-should-you-read-it/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jul 2021 11:14:14 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/freakonomics-should-you-read-it/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Why do drug-dealers still live with their mothers?&amp;rdquo;

What I want to do? What I want to be? So, I am forced to think about these questions. Indeed, what do I wanna do?
I reread the poignant &amp;ldquo;A Thousand Splendid Suns&amp;rdquo; by Khaled Hosseini. So, I have a habit, for better or worse, of poking around the central content to appreciate the big picture.</description></item><item><title>Is Governance Really So Difficult?</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/is-governance-really-so-difficult/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 13:15:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/is-governance-really-so-difficult/</guid><description>Why is taking economic decisions at a national level such a tantalizing task? Why do government policies fail (sometimes miserably)? Why are people still living on the streets under BPL?
You can expose yourself to an array of criticism and theories spun by supposedly thoughtful individuals at any cafe. These folks go on blurting how the present is worse than a decade ago and on and on. I had heard about their side, I wanted to know about the other side too.</description></item><item><title>Friendship</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/friendship/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 11:37:34 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/friendship/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;How many times had she, Hasina, and Giti said those same three words to each other, Laila wondered, said it without hesitation, after only two or three days of not seeing each other?
I missed you, Hasina. Oh, I missed you too. In Tariq&amp;rsquo;s grimace, Laila learned that boys differed from girls in this regard. They didn&amp;rsquo;t make a show of friendship.

This love of mine can turn aggressive, even generously self-depreciative, which is a source of concern. I maintain a digital library simply because there won&amp;rsquo;t be enough room for all the books if I build for myself a physical library (Now you know how to impress me 😉). I spend literally hours fretting about organization, intensely debating with myself what parameters to organize under, designing programs to maintain a catalog, devising makeshift ways to register progress and so on.</description></item><item><title>Notes: The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-the-millionaire-fastlane-by-mj-demarco/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 21:02:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-the-millionaire-fastlane-by-mj-demarco/</guid><description>Are you able to successfully leverage the opportunities at your disposal? That is the question that this book tries to answer and provides advice backed by the author&amp;rsquo;s own experiences. The book is written in a comfortable conversational style, including way too many metaphors and analogies.
The author, himself, has a remarkable lifestyle: starting a tech company during the dot-com bubble, growing it, selling it and so on. Below I have aggregated few core ideas from the book.</description></item><item><title>Migrating From Jekyll to Hugo</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/migrating-from-jekyll-to-hugo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 10:34:14 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/migrating-from-jekyll-to-hugo/</guid><description>This is a quick note for the convenience of the readers.
With a heave of pleasant sigh, I can inform you all that I am migrating from jekyll to hugo. Finally.
The only hindrance (so to speak) was the choice of a decent theme which, as you can see, has been accomplished. Hugo has a ton of features and conveniences that I would be foolish to not take advantage of. Archetypes, built-in shortcodes, KaTeX typesetting, taxonomies beside being so fast!</description></item><item><title>Bookshelf</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/bookshelf/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jun 2021 22:24:36 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/bookshelf/</guid><description>Abstract Inspired by Patrick Collison&amp;rsquo;s luscious bookshelf, this page is the list of books I have read in the current year (whichever year you are reading it). Most of these are plucked from other people&amp;rsquo;s recommendation lists, popular choices, stuff I find interesting or just a random topic I want to learn about on a Saturday evening. Suggestions? Drop me a line!

This is a blog about psychology, philosophy, economics, technology, science, art and design. It is not proper to believe this blog is limited to the handful of subjects listed above because it is not. To understand our lives demands a multidisciplinary stance.
In brief, it is about every subject encompassing human existence.
Perhaps, a better explanation is given by ACX which I quote:</description></item><item><title>Most Scarce Resource</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/most-scarce-resource/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/most-scarce-resource/</guid><description>What is the single most scarce resource at the disposal of man?
The present.
It cannot be acquired or earned. It is available to all in equal measure. It cannot be claimed forever unlike knowledge or lost like friends. We may eschew society to do our biddings but all must surrender to this moment.
Anything that you are doing now is a liability and everything else you chose not to do are missed opportunities.</description></item><item><title>The Sun After A Thuderstorm</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/the-sun-after-a-thuderstorm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/the-sun-after-a-thuderstorm/</guid><description>There is something magical about the first sunshine after a thunderstorm. The coolness of the still wet ground and the warm sunshine vapourising the dew. The mist hanging low over the floor mixing with the musky smell of freshly spawned algae. The chirping of the songbird as they return to their nests mingling with the chattering of the hawkers and peddlers as they return to the streets below.</description></item><item><title>Notes: I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Ramit Sethi</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-by-ramit-sethi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-by-ramit-sethi/</guid><description>Sethi&amp;rsquo;s book, at it&amp;rsquo;s core, is a set of rules and tricks that can be applied by an aware and motivated individual to ensure a life of abundance relative to their current financial standings. Motivated to become rich himself (and hailing from India) at a young age, Sethi learnt from his blunders and noted his successes. He started blogging about his wins which eventually evolved into this book. Needless to say, his advice are well-researched, practical and tested.</description></item><item><title>What Makes You Powerful?</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/what-makes-you-powerful/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/what-makes-you-powerful/</guid><description>Do you want to know what makes one powerful?

What is wealth? Wealth is a power. With wealth, many things are possible.

Fate is unpredictable hence untrustworthy. It makes wanton spenders and misers alike.

On their first discourse, Kamala asks him what is he capable of doing that he can trade for money, pretty clothes, shoes, sweet perfumes and gifts for her. To which Siddhartha replies,
&amp;ldquo;I can think. I can wait. I can fast.&amp;rdquo;
I think that is a very profound answer and it will do ignorant fools like us much good if we make an attempt to comprehend it.</description></item><item><title>Going Public</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/going-public/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/going-public/</guid><description>Circumstances have forced me to mull over unprecedented actions.

Your biggest asset - &amp;ldquo;Learn whatever you want to achieve your vision&amp;rdquo;. Good designs are timeless. They can awe people of any era. Fundamental soul of a human creation that expresses itself in successive outer layers of the product. Designing of a system comes before building it not after. Affect emotion, build credibility, earn trust. Don&amp;rsquo;t draw ponies. First visual interaction thus heuristic shortcut to judge credibility. Purpose | Medium and Technology | Aesthetics Good design choices are a set of ideas that must mature in the mind.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts: Design for Hackers (Book)</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-design-for-hackers-book/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-design-for-hackers-book/</guid><description>Design. An idea which I admit rather shamefully to not have paid any serious attention to (until now).
Design of a system happens before building not after.
This, it seems, is a general attitude towards design by builders and engineers or people who work on the guts or so called backend of a system as was coyly pointed out by the author himself.
Unfortunately, it is true. Design is something I have always thought of as an after thought in my projects at least uptil now.</description></item><item><title>Notes: Habits by James Clear</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-habits-by-james-clear/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/notes-habits-by-james-clear/</guid><description>My Notes Introduction Majority fail in making habits because they try to make changes the wrong way.
It is easy to get obssessed with the result.
Never overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making better decisions on a daily basis.
Don&amp;rsquo;t focus on the destination. Focus on the path.
Habits Pattern of every habit:</description></item><item><title>Gemini Protocol</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/gemini-protocol/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/gemini-protocol/</guid><description>Gemini is a minimal application layer request-response protocol that aims to make a Geminispace of information to be accessible to anyone even with slow/intermittent internet connection. Think HTTP 0.9 or a less restraining Gopher.
TLDR If you haven&amp;rsquo;t checked out Gemini yet, you totally should. This is a HTTP proxy to the actual gemini site.
Why Gemini? I really value your time and understand you have better things to do. So, I&amp;rsquo;ll cut down on formalities and introductions and preludes and yada yada.</description></item><item><title>Specialisation</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/specialisation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/specialisation/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is-this-about">What is this about?&lt;/h2>

Living in the now, the present versus living for the future. This is not a mutually exclusive choice. One must possess both qualities and be able to switch back and forth effortlessly between them.
Living for the future is stressful in the present but generally blissful for the future. You might argue that this must be the optimum choice but the conflict is you are preparing for something non existent and moreover, expending your present to do so and effective using what you can only ever experience, the present.</description></item><item><title>Systems and Everything Else</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/systems-and-everything-else/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/systems-and-everything-else/</guid><description>This is probably the best life skill I have come across in a while that I wish to talk about.
What is this post about? Have you struggled to find a bearing in the world? With so much information and activity to process, does it make your mind feel despaired? Have you endeavored (tried?) to find a list of fundamental principles to live by? Everyone has a core belief through which stems (either consciously or unconsciouly) all of their thoughts and actions.</description></item><item><title>Year in Books: 2020</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/bs/yib2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/bs/yib2020/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s Get Started The Rosie Project | Graeme Simsion
My first read this year (2020). I started just after taking the last of my annuals and I remember laughing hard. It&amp;rsquo;s a romcom about a genetic professor suffering from Asperger&amp;rsquo;s trying to find a wife. The Wife Project still gives me giggles. Oh and I remember picking this up after seeing it on Bill Gate&amp;rsquo;s to-read list.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts: The Selfish Gene (Book)</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-the-selfish-gene-book/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/thoughts-the-selfish-gene-book/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>

Why do I have to buy music? In a nutshell, because I want to. But seriously, why in a world of Spotify and pirated downloadable songs would I have the brilliant idea to buy music?</description></item><item><title>My First Open Source Excursion</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/my-first-open-source-excursion/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/my-first-open-source-excursion/</guid><description>Granted that I have atleast a dozen projects hanging in midair (figuratively) on my hard disk (literally). And I have a couple of repos on github in near stasis but today I had my first whiff of open source. Open source doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean much without collaboration and today I dabbled in real time. Contributing code to a public repo, getting feedback and watching it getting approved. Oh! I felt rewarded.</description></item><item><title>Stuck by Fandom for the First Time in My Life</title><link>https://basil08.github.io/post/stuck-by-fandom-for-the-first-time-in-my-life/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basil08.github.io/post/stuck-by-fandom-for-the-first-time-in-my-life/</guid><description>Ethereal, heavenly, celestial, opulent, splendid, otherworldly - these adjectives form the regular staple of people who dare to describe the music of the Cocteau Twins (pronounced: cock-tow twins). Honestly, I think it&amp;rsquo;s an effort in vain. Because this band defies all possibilities of being defined by words. Cage them in artificial genres and you will fail. You can only experience their &amp;ldquo;sacred microcosm&amp;rdquo; yourself as Azam Ali so eloquently puts it.</description></item></channel></rss>
